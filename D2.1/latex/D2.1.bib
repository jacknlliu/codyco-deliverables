abstract = {OBJECTIVES Protective steps are essential for fall avoidance. Most studies only examined forwards stepping despite considerable bio-mechanical and visual differences between the forwards and backwards directions. We assess forward–backward differences in protective steps in a young and elderly group. METHODS Protective stepping responses were elicited by a platform moving unpredictably either forwards or backwards. For control purposes, voluntary steps, in response to vibration cues on the forehead or occiput were also recorded. Reaction time (RT), length and angular velocity of the steps were measured in 13 young (age 19–35years) and 13 elderly (age 58–86years) healthy volunteers. RESULTS (i) Protective vs voluntary steps: protective steps were earlier, faster and longer than voluntary steps. (ii) Forwards–backwards differences: RT was quicker for backwards than forwards protective steps, in contrast to voluntary steps where RTs were similar in the two directions. (iii) Age difference: the elderly had universally slower steps and they generated shorter backwards than forwards protective steps. CONCLUSIONS Protective steps appear more robust than voluntary steps – they are earlier (shorter RT), longer and faster than voluntary steps, indicating an automatic rather than a volitional reaction. Backwards protective steps occur earlier than forwards; such promptness may have evolved out of bio-mechanical features which make falling backwards easier. Since our elderly subjects had an average age <70years, their slower and shorter protective backwards steps may represent the first abnormality in this rescue postural response. The findings in the elderly may partly depend on dysfunction in fronto-basal ganglia postural loops.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of legged vehicles has progressed significantly in recent years. These vehicles offer the potential of increased mobility for traversing rough terrain. The ability to maintain stability is an important consideration in the development of any control algorithm for a legged vehicle. Previous work on legged vehicle control generally assumes that the terrain is regular enough that only minimal operator interaction is necessary. However, for very irregular terrain the operator may require a guidance mode that gives maximum resolution and flexibility in controlling body, leg, position, and orientation. Several automatic body regulation schemes that aid the operator in this important task are described. A major development is the use of an improved stability measure which can be automatically optimized. This measure, together with a consideration of constraints on the kinematic limits of individual legs, leads to the development of schemes for automatic body regulation. The automatic body regulation schemes are incorporated into the vehicle control algorithm to provide a high degree of vehicle maneuverability while reducing the operator's burden.},

	Abstract = {Some stability criteria for walking vehicles on rough terrain are discussed. Several criteria for stability margin have been proposed previously and they can be roughly divided into three categories. The paper compares them with each other and concludes that a stability criterion based on energy consideration is the most reasonable for practical use through simple experiments. The existing stability margin is apparently inadequate because it varies with weight of the vehicle with the same posture, while weight doesn't affect its resistance to a tumble. Therefore, an improved stability margin normalized by weight is proposed. At the same time, a helpful tool to derive the desirable posture for walking vehicles is described which can maximize the proposed stability margin on rough terrain.},

To avoid tipover in an automatic system, or to provide a human operator with an indication of proximity to tipover, it is necessary to define a measure of stability margin. This work presents a new tipover stability measure (the force-angle stability measure) which is easily computed and sensitive to topheaviness. The proposed metric is applicable to systems subject to inertial and external forces, operating over even or uneven terrains. Performance of the measure is demonstrated using a forestry vehicle simulation},

@article{Garcia2006,
	Abstract = {It is a widespread idea that animal-legged locomotion is better than wheeled locomotion on natural rough terrain. However, the use of legs as a locomotion system for vehicles and robots still has a long way to go before it can compete with wheels and trucks, even on natural ground. This paper aims to solve two main disadvantages plaguing walking robots: their inability to react to external disturbances (which is also a drawback of wheeled robots); and their extreme slowness. Both problems are reduced here by combining: 1) a gait-parameter-adaptation method that maximizes a dynamic energy stability margin and 2) an active-compliance controller with a new term that compensates for stability variations, thus helping the robot react stably in the face of disturbances. As a result, the combined gait-adaptation approach helps the robot achieve faster, more stable compliant motions than conventional controllers. Experiments performed with the SILO4 quadruped robot show a relevant improvement in the walking gait},

	Abstract = {In the area of biped robot research, much progress has been made in the past few years. However, some difficulties remain to be dealt with, particularly about the implementation of fast and dynamic walking gaits, in other words anthropomorphic gaits, especially on uneven terrain. In this perspective, both concepts of center of pressure (CoP) and zero moment point (ZMP) are obviously useful. In this paper, the two concepts are strictly defined, the CoP with respect to ground-feet contact forces, the ZMP with respect to gravity plus inertia forces. Then, the coincidence of CoP and ZMP is proven, and related control aspects are examined. Finally, a virtual CoP-ZMP is defined, allowing us to extend the concept when walking on uneven terrain. This paper is a theoretical study. Experimental results are presented in a companion paper, analyzing the evolution of the ground contact forces obtained from a human walker wearing robot feet as shoes.},

	Abstract = {Some symptoms related to disequilibrium may not be detected by a clinical exam. Therefore, objective study is important in assessing balance. In this paper, methods to measure balance in computer posturography are compared. Center of pressure (COP) displacement, equilibrium score (ES) and postural stability index (PSI), the main measures of assessing balance are described and their merits and disadvantages are discussed. Clinicians should apply that measure which suits the specific strategies in a specific situation. Measuring devices such as Force plate, Balance Master and Equitest are also discussed. Although the Balance Master and Equitest devices are more costly compared to the force plate only, they are more useful for assessing balance relevant to daily life activities that might result in falls.},
