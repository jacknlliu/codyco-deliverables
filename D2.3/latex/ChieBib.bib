  title = {Why Don{\textquoteright}t We Move Slower? The Value of Time in the
	Neural Control of Action},
  journal = {Journal of Neuroscience},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {36},
  pages = {1056--1070},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {To want something now rather than later is a common attitude that
	reflects the brain{\textquoteright}s tendency to value the passage
	of time. Because the time taken to accomplish an action inevitably
	delays task achievement and reward acquisition, this idea was ported
	to neural movement control within the {\textquotedblleft}cost of
	time{\textquotedblright} theory. This theory provides a normative
	framework to account for the underpinnings of movement time formation
	within the brain and the origin of a self-selected pace in human
	and animal motion. Then, how does the brain exactly value time in
	the control of action? To tackle this issue, we used an inverse optimal
	control approach and developed a general methodology allowing to
	squarely sample infinitesimal values of the time cost from experimental
	motion data. The cost of time underlying saccades was found to have
	a concave growth, thereby confirming previous results on hyperbolic
	reward discounting, yet without making any prior assumption about
	this hypothetical nature. For self-paced reaching, however, movement
	time was primarily valued according to a striking sigmoidal shape;
	its rate of change consistently presented a steep rise before a maximum
	was reached and a slower decay was observed. Theoretical properties
	of uniqueness and robustness of the inferred time cost were established
	for the class of problems under investigation, thus reinforcing the
	significance of the present findings. These results may offer a unique
	opportunity to uncover how the brain values the passage of time in
	healthy and pathological motor control and shed new light on the
	processes underlying action invigoration.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Movement
	time is a fundamental characteristic of neural motor control, but
	the principles underlying its formation remain little known. This
	work addresses that question within the inverse optimal control framework
	where the challenge is to uncover what optimality criterion underlies
	a system{\textquoteright}s behavior. Here we rely on the {\textquotedblleft}cost
	of time{\textquotedblright} theory that finds its roots into the
	brain{\textquoteright}s tendency to discount the actual value of
	future reward. It asserts that the time elapsed until action completion
	entails a cost, thereby making slow moves nonoptimal. By means of
	a thorough theoretical analysis, the present article shows how to
	sample the infinitesimal values of the time cost without prior assumption
	about its hypothetical nature and emphasizes its sigmoidal shape
	for reaching.},

	A fundamental feature of human motor control is the ability to vary
	effortlessly over a substantial range, both the duration and amplitude
	of our movements. We used a three-dimensional robotic interface,
	which generated novel velocity dependent forces on the hand, to investigate
	how adaptation to these altered dynamics experienced only for movements
	at one temporal rate and amplitude generalizes to movements made
	at a different rate or amplitude. After subjects had learned to make
	a single point-to-point movement in a novel velocity-dependent force
	field, we examined the generalization of this learning to movements
	of both half the duration or twice the amplitude. Such movements
	explore a state-space not experienced during learning{\textemdash}any
	changes in behavior are due to generalization of the learning, the
	form of which was used to probe the intrinsic constraints on the
	motor control process. The generalization was assessed by determining
	the force field in which subjects produced kinematically normal movements.
	We found substantial generalization of the motor learning to the
	new movements supporting a nonlocal representation of the control
	process. Of the fields tested, the form of the generalization was
	best characterized by linear extrapolation in a state-space representation
	of the controller. Such an intrinsic constraint on the motor control
	process can facilitate the scaling of natural movements.},
