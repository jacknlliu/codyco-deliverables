  abstract = {A novel artificial skin for covering the wholebody of a humanoid robot
is presented. It provides pressuremeasurements and shape information
about the contactsurfaces between the robot and the environment.
The system isbased on a mesh of sensors interconnected in order to
form anetworked structure. Each sensor has 12 capacitive taxels,
hasa triangular shape and is supported by a flexible substrate inorder
to conform to smooth curved surfaces. Threecommunications ports placed
along the sides of each sensorsides allow communications with adjacent
sensors. The tactilemeasurements are sent to embed microcontroller
boards usingserial bus communication links. The system can adaptivelyreduce
its spatial resolution, improving the response time. Thisfeature
is very useful for detecting the first contact veryrapidly, at a
lower spatial resolution, and then increase thespatial resolution
in the region of contact for accuratereconstruction of the contact
pressure distribution.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method for calculating operational-space
inertia matrices, and other related quantities, for branched kinematic
trees. It is based on the exploitation of branch-induced sparsity
in the joint-space inertia matrix and the task Jacobian. Detailed
cost figures are given for the new method, and its efficacy is demonstrated
by means of a realistic example based on the ASIMO Next-Generation
humanoid robot. In this example, the new method is shown to be 6.7
times faster than the basic matrix method, and 1.6 times faster than
the efficient low-order algorithm of Rodriguez et al. Furthermore,
cost savings of more than 50,000 arithmetic operations are obtained
in the calculation of the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse of the task
Jacobian and its null-space projection matrix. Additional examples
are considered briefly, in order to further compare the new method
with the algorithm of Rodriguez et al. 10.1177/0278364909357644},

  pages = {149-164},
  abstract = {Safe planning and control is essential to bringing human-robot interaction
into common experience. This paper presents an integrated human?robot
interaction strategy that ensures the safety of the human participant
through a coordinated suite of safety strategies that are selected
and implemented to anticipate and respond to varying time horizons
for potential hazards and varying expected levels of interaction
with the user. The proposed planning and control strategies are based
on explicit measures of danger during interaction. The level of danger
is estimated based on factors influencing the impact force during
a human-robot collision, such as the effective robot inertia, the
relative velocity and the distance between the robot and the human.
A second key requirement for improving safety is the ability of the
robot to perceive its environment, and more specifically, human behavior
and reaction to robot movements. This paper also proposes and demonstrates
the use of human monitoring information based on vision and physiological
sensors to further improve the safety of the human robot interaction.
A methodology for integrating sensor-based information about the
user's position and physiological reaction to the robot into medium
and short-term safety strategies is presented. This methodology is
verified through a series of experimental test cases where a human
and an articulated robot respond to each other based on the human's
physical and physiological behavior.},

  abstract = {A novel embedded distributed capacitive tactile sensor system designed
to be installed on humanoid robots is presented. It provides pressure
and shape information about the contacts with objects and the environment.
The system is based on conformable mesh of sensors having triangular
shape, interconnected in order to form a networked structure. Each
triangle is a flexible substrate allowing the sensor to be conformed
to smooth curved surfaces. It provides 12 capacitive measurements
and it has three communications ports placed along its sides: one
for the input from an adjacent triangle, and the others as outputs
toward adjacent triangles. Each triangle is therefore a single sensor
module implementing 12 taxels. The measurements are sent to microcontroller
boards using serial bus communication links. A microcontroller board
set-up and reads the data coming from a group of modules. Every microcontroller
board has a CAN-bus link. The spatial resolution of the skin is one
sensor every 5mm. The aim of the project is to install the artificial
skin on the humanoid robot iCub, for studying control strategy using
tactile feedback coming from the whole body, but it can be used for
many other different mechatronic applications where distributed pressure
information along a surface are required},

This activity is part of a general upgrade of the humanoid robot
to provide the entire 53 degree of freedom robot with low-level joint
torque control. In particular, the shoulder is challenging because
of the complex and compact mechanism of the shoulder. We first modeled
the behaviour of the sensors with analytical equations and the sensor
geometry were subsequently optimized using finite element structural
simulations. The sensors were then constructed, and integrated in
the arm assembly. Finally we present preliminary experiments to validate
the design.}

stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock
tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force
control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity
for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness
also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors
propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't
everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element
within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity
instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical
spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent
in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system
for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors
conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator
meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small
planetary rover.},

  abstract = {This paper handles the problem of collision avoidance in a multi-robot
environment. To solve this problem, the motion processes of the mobile
robots are modelled in space-time. Since the robots are autonomous
and communication is non-deterministic, there is temporal uncertainty
in addition to spatial uncertainty. The paper presents a method to
model both uncertainty components in a homogeneous way. It is shown,
that it is not sufficient to guarantee a spatial security distance
between the robots. Distances in space-time and space-time vectors
must be considered. The main result of this paper is a straightforward
and efficient solution to the problem of collision avoidance between
up to three mobile robots by applying a space-time displacement vector.
The solution is based on space-time, which is a helpful view onto
our world in relativity theory and quantum physics. Space-time methods
are also very valuable in Robotics, especially for problems in dynamic
environments and for motion coordination of mobile robots. Practical
experiments with up to two robots, and simulations of up to three
robots have been performed and are reported.},

  abstract = {With robotics hardware becoming more and more safe and compliant,
robots are not far from entering our homes. The robot, that will
share the same environment with humans, will be expected to consider
the geometry of the interaction and to perform intelligent space
sharing. In this case, even the simplest tasks, e.g. handing over
an object to a person, raise important questions such as: where the
task should be achieved?; how to place the robot relatively to the
human in order to ease the human action?; how to hand over an object?;
and more generally, how to move in a relatively constrained environment
in the presence of humans? In this paper we present an integrated
motion synthesis framework from planning to execution that is especially
designed for a robot that interacts with humans. This framework,
composed of Perspective Placement, Human Aware Manipulation Planner
and Soft Motion Trajectory Planner, generates robot motions by taking
into account humanÂs safety; his vision field and his perspective;
his kinematics and his posture along with the task constraints.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel neural network approach to real-time collision-free
path planning of robot manipulators in a nonstationary environment
is proposed, which is based on a biologically inspired neural network
model for dynamic trajectory generation of a point mobile robot.
The state space of the proposed neural network is the joint space
of the robot manipulators, where the dynamics of each neuron is characterized
by a shunting equation or an additive equation. The real-time robot
path is planned through the varying neural activity landscape that
represents the dynamic environment. The proposed model for robot
path planning with safety consideration is capable of planning a
real-time comfortable path without suffering from the too close nor
too far problems. The model algorithm is computationally efficient.
The computational complexity is linearly dependent on the neural
network size. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through
simulation studies.},
