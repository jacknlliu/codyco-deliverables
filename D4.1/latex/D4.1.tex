\chapter{Introduction}

This deliverable presents results of task T4.1 and of task T4.2 at the end of the thrid year. The achieved results are briefly discussed with respect to the task description from the Technical Annex.

\paragraph{T4.1 Generalizing and Improving Elementary Tasks with Contacts.} 
Analytical models that include physical robot-environment contact are frequently not sufficiently accurate
for gentle and dextrous interaction with the environment. Hence, there is a strong need for improved
models that enable more versatile predictions (e.g., of the next state or a force required to accomplish an
acceleration) for whole-body contact. Core problems in these contexts are under-modelled nonlinearities
(e.g., hydraulic tubes, cable drives, etc.) as well as that the various contact situations have substantially
different interactive behaviour. As there may be unforeseeably many possible scenarios, real-time
regression techniques may be one of the most reasonable approaches for such kind of problems. However,
we avoid the classical problem of learning from scratch but rather learn the part of the dynamics that has
not been captured by the preceding classical system identification techniques. The resulting model is
obviously more accurate than the original and its training more efficient. As the type of contact may decide
upon the type of interaction, it is an essential feature. However, it is not directly accessible but a latent
cause for a change in behaviour and needs to be inferred online in real-time. Hence, new real-time
regression techniques need to be developed particularly for a multi-contact situation where multiple model
classes exist and generalization between different latent contacts. Here is a list of achievements for this task:
\begin{itemize}

\item TUD learned predictive models of joint angles and task-space forces in a probabilistic control framework. 
Early results were presented at the end of year two. In particular, TUD developed a model-free control method that can be
trained from demonstrations and generates time-varying feedback control gains that reproduces
the demonstrations. In this approach a joint distribution over states, sensory feedback (e.g.,
measured joint torques or contact forces) and controls is learned. In conditioning on the
current state the next-state control-law can be computed in closed form approximating the
true forward dynamics through local linearizations given the demonstrations. During year three, TUD refined this approach 
and evaluated the model-free ProMP method on the humanoid robot iCub in lifting objects. The model could generalize to 
different object weights and grasp locations. A paper was published and presented at the IEEE/RSJ Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) in Hamburg, Germany 2015 \cite{Paraschos_IROS_2015}. 
This work is discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:AlexIROS}. 

% \item Propose a general architecture that estimate the latent type of physical interaction and learn
% models of the system and its interaction with the environment accordingly.
% 
% \textit{TODO}

% \item Possible latent physical interaction type models are the different human contact models, different
% rigid contact models and different compliant contact models. Similarly, there may be different
% situations (soft, unstable, unpredictable surfaces; stable, unstable, contact, etc.).
% 
% \textit{TODO}

% 
% \item Bayesian inference is used to infer the current latent physical interaction type and results in an
% appropriate interaction model.
% 
% \item If the existing interaction models can no longer explain the current behaviour during physical
% contact, new contact models are generated and trained online. For each new contact type, also a
% new corresponding interaction control law is trained.
% 
% \textit{TODO}
% 
% \item The physical model, as well as previous contact models, serve as a Bayesian prior to ensure that
% learning does not happen from scratch.
% 
% \item The resulting approach is verified in the setting of several CoDyCo scenarios: contact with different
% soft, unstable, unpredictable surfaces, contacts with humans, rigid or compliant objects, etc.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{T4.2 Inferring the Operational Space and Appropriate Controls with Multiple Contacts.} 
Operational space control (OSC) is among the most general frameworks for phrasing control tasks. It allows
formulating the task in its own inherent space instead of using a more action-oriented space such as the
joint-space. Current approaches use human insight for finding the appropriate task space and analytical
physical models in order to compute the appropriate controls that realize the task (Nakanishi et al., 2008).
Clearly model errors can have devastating impacts on the performance of operational space control laws
and, hence, learning approaches have been introduced (Peters \& Schaal, 2008) (Sala√ºn et al., 2010). As
these learning approaches do not yet include contact, the extension to a multi-contact scenario will be
essential. However, this step is neither straightforward nor incremental. Only by relying on the latent
contact inference engine from T4.1, the new Learning OSC module will be able to deal with learning
multiple different OSCs for different scenarios.

An additional trouble arises from finding the appropriate space for a task. This step is known to be very
difficult, as here the latent manifold of the task will need to be considered. We will present a machine
learning approach that will recover the latent task space from the data and models provided by WP2. 
Here is a list of achievements for this task:
\begin{itemize}

\item For controlling high-dimensional robots, most stochastic optimal 
control algorithms use approximations of the system dynamics and of the cost function (e.g.,
using linearizations and Taylor expansions). These approximations are typically only locally
correct, which might cause instabilities in the greedy policy updates, lead to oscillations or the
algorithms diverge. To overcome these drawbacks, TUD added a regularization term to the
cost function that punishes large policy update steps in the trajectory optimization procedure.
TUD applied this concept to the Approximate Inference Control method (AICO), where the
resulting algorithm guarantees convergence for uninformative initial solutions without complex
hand-tuning of learning rates. The new algorithm was evaluated on two simulated robotic platforms. A robot arm with
 five joints was used for reaching multiple targets while keeping the roll angle constant. On the
humanoid robot Nao, we show how complex skills like reaching and balancing 
can be inferred from desired center of gravity or end effector coordinates. This work was
presented at the International Conference on Humanoid Robots (HUMANOIDS) in Madrid, Spain in 2014 \cite{AICOHumanoidsFinal}. The stochastic optimal 
control algorithm is discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:ElmarHumanoids}. 

\item In an ongoing student project, TUD currently evaluates this approach on a real system (the Nao robot). A journal paper is in progress of writing. 

\item Another source of inspiration for novel operational space control algorithms is drawn from observations of how animals solve planning tasks. 
In particular, TUD investigated how spiking neural networks can be used to learn 
a mapping between joint and task space and utilized this mapping in a temporal model for movement planning. 
A paper demonstrating for the first time how a spiking neural network architecture can
implement probabilistic planning through local reward modulated synaptic plasticity rules was published the journal of Scientific Reports \cite{Rueckert_SR_2016}. 
The main contribution is a theoretical model with implications for neuroscience studies on path
planning in the hippocampus and robot controller implemented on neuromorphic hardware.
Optimal learning rules were derived based on probabilistic inference and links to the widely
used machine learning techniques expectation maximization and policy search were 
established. 

As computational model for hippocampal sweeps during maze navigation tasks, the model
suggests that contextual information about rewarding goal locations or obstacles modulate
not only the end point of a path (as done in state-of-the-art attractor models) but the complete
movement trajectory. 

For robotics, the resulting neural network offers the foundation for future neuromorphic
hardware implementations that can be used in dynamic human robot co-worker
environments. In this challenging domain large sensory streams from cameras and tactile
skins have to processed and stochastic decisions have to be computed based on noisy or
partial observations taking future expectations about human motion into account. In first
experiments, it is shown that the neural model can be trained to represent and generate multimodal
movement plans that avoid obstacles in a real robot arm reaching task in real-time. This work is discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:ElmarScientificReports}.

\item In a student's Master thesis, TUD refined the above spiking neural network model to a deep neural network architecture. 
In using factorized population codes, the model could generalize to high-dimensional robot systems (i.e., a robot with more than six joints). 
TUD demonstrated that both, the state transition model and the inverse kinematic model can be learned from human demonstrations using kinesthetic teaching. 
For that purpose TUD derived a spike dependent version of contrastive divergence. The models are learned and evaluated on a KUKA lightweight arm in simulation
and on the real robot by solving target reaching and obstacle avoidance tasks. A paper on these results is currently in progress of writing. 


% \item As a first step, the different operational space control laws will be learning on data from WP2 based
% on a given a set of contacts, appropriate responses and a pre-specified task-space. An evaluation of
% this control law on the iCub is given for ‚Äústance and reaching action with the other hand free‚Äù from
% WP2.
% 
% \textit{TODO}
% 
% \item The latent operational space is extracted from data from WP2 and, as a result, the OSC laws can be learned without specifying the task space manually.
% 
% \textit{TODO}
% 
% 
% \item Using the latent contact model form T4.1, assumptions on the inputs are relaxed and the OSC laws
% become more widely applicable. A demonstration of a ‚Äústance and reaching action with one hand
% on a rigid support table‚Äù is given as an evaluation on the iCub. Generalization to other, non-rigid
% type of contact will be possible.

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Executive Summary}

In this deliverable, three studies relevant for improving operational space 
control with contacts are presented. The first work demonstrates how model-free 
probabilistic movement primitives can be learned from human demonstrations and 
generalize to different task-space forces. In a second study, TUD demonstrated 
how a simple regularization term can greatly improve the convergence properties 
of incremental stochastic optimal control methods. This work was evaluated in 
simulations and is currently tested on real humanoid robots. In the last chapter 
of this deliverable we present an interesting control approach using spiking 
neural networks. The approach does not aim at solving the challenging control 
problems within CoDyCo but rather provides an alternative with great potentials 
for future research. As such TUD is investigating how deep neural network 
variants of this model can be used for controlling real robots in high-dimensional joint and task 
spaces.
