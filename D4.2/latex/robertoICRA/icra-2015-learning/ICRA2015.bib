  Abstract                 = {A novel artificial skin for covering the whole body of a humanoid robot is presented. It provides pressure measurements and shape information about the contact surfaces between the robot and the environment. The system is based on a mesh of sensors interconnected in order to form a networked structure. Each sensor has 12 capacitive taxels, has a triangular shape and is supported by a flexible substrate in order to conform to smooth curved surfaces. Three communications ports placed along the sides of each sensor sides allow communications with adjacent sensors. The tactile measurements are sent to embed microcontroller boards using serial bus communication links. The system can adaptively reduce its spatial resolution, improving the response time. This feature is very useful for detecting the first contact very rapidly, at a lower spatial resolution, and then increase the spatial resolution in the region of contact for accurate reconstruction of the contact pressure distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and robotics for more than a decade since data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount of engineering knowledge, which is otherwise required. However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this article, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.},
