abstract = {An analysis of underactuated manipulators from both the dynamic and the control points of view is presented. While the unactuated joints dynamic equation is recognized to be a nonholonomic constraint in the general case, necessary and sufficient conditions are given to identify special cases in which such a constraint is integrable. In contrast to most examples in the literature, the unactuated joints dynamics is an instance of a second-order nonholonomic constraint. it is shown that smooth feedback stabilization to a single equilibrium point is not possible, and a feedback scheme providing stabilization to a manifold of equilibrium positions is proposed},

abstract = {In this chapter we discuss the control of underactuated mechanical systems. Underactuated mechanical systems have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom and arise in applications, such as space and undersea robots, mobile robots, flexible robots, walking, branchiating, and gymnastic robots. The Lagrangian dynamics of these systems may contain feedforward nonlinearities, non-minimum phase zero dynamics, nonholonomic constraints, and other properties that place this class of systems at the forefront of research in nonlinear control [22, 15]. A complete understanding of the control of these systems is therefore lacking. We will discuss the application of geometric nonlinear control, as well as methods based on passivity and energy for stabilization and tracking control. We will survey some of the existing results and point to open research problems.},

abstract = {Perceptual functions are central to many applications in robotics and for the construction of efficient human?robot interfaces. The study of perception in biological systems has revealed important information-processing principles that have been converted to powerful applications in robotics and computer vision. The chapter first discusses two central theories of object recognition: model- and exemplar-based theories. A review of experimental results from the study of object recognition in biological systems suggests that exemplar-based approaches capture important properties of object recognition in the brain. We then discuss how very similar principles have been realized in highly efficient technical systems for object recognition and detection, including realizations that are based on biologically inspired neural architectures. Principles for the efficient processing of complex shapes can be extended to the representation of complex movements and actions. We illustrate this by first reviewing some propert ies of the cortical mechanisms of the recognition of complex movements and actions, focusing on principles that are useful for robotics applications. Again, exemplar-based approaches seem to capture important properties of motion recognition in the brain, and at the same time provide a powerful approach for building technical movement recognition systems. Finally, it is shown that the example-based framework is not only useful for recognition, but also provides the basis for powerful synthesis methods. As one example we discuss the synthesis of photorealistic three-dimensional (3-D) models of faces, training examples. Related approaches have been developed for spatiotemporal patterns. We review a class of algorithms that permit the accurate modeling of movements and movement styles by interpolation between example trajectories with high relevance for the synthesis of movements, e.g., in humanoid robotics.},

@article{Anderson2005a,
abstract = {Adaptive control is a very appealing technology, at least in principle. Yet its use has been conditioned by an attitude of distrustfulness on the part of some practitioners. In this paper, we explain why such distrustfulness is warranted, by reviewing a number of adaptive control approaches which have proved deficient for some reason that has not been immediately apparent. The explanation of the deficiencies, which normally were reflected in unexpected instabilities, is our main concern. Such explanations, coupled with remedies for avoiding the deficiencies, are necessary to engender confidence in the technology. These include the unpredictable failure of the MIT rule; the bursting phenomenon, and how to prevent it; the Rohrs counterexample, which attempted to disqualify all adaptive control algorithms; the notion that identification of a plant is only valid conceptually for a restricted range of controllers (with the implication that in adaptive control, certain controller changes suggested by adaptive control algorithms may introduce instability); and the concept of multiple model adaptive control.},

@book{Siciliano2009,
abstract = {The classic text on robot manipulators now covers visual control, motion planning and mobile robots too!Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations.The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses:\^{a} the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and\^{a} the technology of actuators, sensors and control units.Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in:\^{a} dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators;\^{a} mobile robots;\^{a} motion planning; and\^{a} interaction with the environment using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision).Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual (downloadable from www.springer.com/978-1-84628-641-4) containing the MATLAB\^{A} code for computer problems; this is available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},

@book{featherstone2008,
	Abstract = {Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms presents the subject of computational rigid-body dynamics through the medium of spatial 6D vector notation. It explains how to model a rigid-body system and how to analyze it, and it presents the most comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms to be found in a single source. The use of spatial vector notation greatly reduces the volume of algebra which allows systems to be described using fewer equations and fewer quantities. It also allows problems to be solved in fewer steps, and solutions to be expressed more succinctly. In addition algorithms are explained simply and clearly, and are expressed in a compact form. The use of spatial vector notation facilitates the implementation of dynamics algorithms on a computer: shorter, simpler code that is easier to write, understand and debug, with no loss of efficiency. Unique features include: A comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms Use of spatial (6D) vectors to greatly reduce the volume of algebra, to simplify the treatment of the subject, and to simplify the computer code that implements the algorithms Algorithms expressed both mathematically and in pseudocode for easy translation into computer programs Source code for many algorithms available on the internet Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms is aimed at readers who already have some elementary knowledge of rigid-body dynamics, and are interested in calculating the dynamics of a rigid-body system. This book serves as an algorithms recipe book as well as a guide to the analysis and deeper understanding of rigid-body systems.},
