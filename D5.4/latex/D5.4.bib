@article{Flash1985,
	Abstract = {This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.},

	Abstract = {{With nearly one billion online videos viewed everyday, an emerging new frontier in computer vision research is recognition and search in video. While much effort has been devoted to the collection and annotation of large scalable static image datasets containing thousands of image categories, human action datasets lag far behind. Current action recognition databases contain on the order of ten different action categories collected under fairly controlled conditions. State-of-the-art performance on these datasets is now near ceiling and thus there is a need for the design and creation of new benchmarks. To address this issue we collected the largest action video database to-date with 51 action categories, which in total contain around 7,000 manually annotated clips extracted from a variety of sources ranging from digitized movies to YouTube. We use this database to evaluate the performance of two representative computer vision systems for action recognition and explore the robustness of these methods under various conditions such as camera motion, viewpoint, video quality and occlusion.}},

	Abstract = {Collecting high-quality biomechanical measurement data for investigating human motion dynamics with muscle driven actuation, i.e., joint trajectories, ground reaction forces and muscle activities, usually requires experienced examiners, expensive measurement equipment and sophisticated processing. Several published databases offer biomechanical measurement data of various human motions. However, most of these databases are not primarily intended for modeling, simulation and validation of human motion dynamics with muscle driven actuation and do not include ground reaction forces together with muscle activities and detailed anthropometric parameters of the subjects. In this paper, the HuMoD Database, a versatile and quite unique combination of comprehensive biomechanical measurement data and anthropometric parameters with a focus on lower limbs, is introduced. The provided datasets allow to create and validate biomechanical models of the human locomotor system on actuation level and to investigate and simulate human motion dynamics including muscle driven actuation. Besides investigations in biomechanics, the database can be of value especially for the design and development of musculoskeletal humanoid robots and for better understanding and benchmarking human-like robot locomotion. The database contains raw and processed biomechanical measurement data from a three-dimensional motion capture system, an instrumented treadmill and an electromyographical measurement system for eight different motion tasks performed by a healthy female and male subject as well as anthropometric parameters for both subjects. The biomechanical measurement data, anthropometric parameters and source code of the applied computational scripts are open and can be obtained free of charge from the HuMoD Database website.},

	Abstract = {Motion databases have a strong potential to guide progress in the field of machine recognition and motion-based animation. Existing databases either have a very loose structure that does not sample the domain according to any controlled methodology or too few action samples which limits their potential to quantitatively evaluate the performance of motion-based techniques. The controlled sampling of the motor domain in the database may lead investigators to identify the fundamental difficulties of motion cognition problems and allow the addressing of these issues in a more objective way. In this paper, we describe the construction of our Human Motion Database using controlled sampling methods (parametric and cognitive sampling) to obtain the structure necessary for the quantitative evaluation of several motion-based research problems. The Human Motion Database is organized into several components: the praxicon dataset, the cross-validation dataset, the generalization dataset, the compositionality dataset, and the interaction dataset. The main contributions of this paper include (1) a survey of human motion databases describing data sources related to motion synthesis and analysis problems, (2) a sampling methodology that takes advantage of a systematic controlled capture, denoted as cognitive sampling and parametric sampling, and (3) a novel structured motion database organized into several datasets addressing a number of aspects in the motion domain.},

	Abstract = {Abstract C3D file format is widely used in the biomechanical field by companies and laboratories to store motion capture systems data. However, few software packages can visualize and modify the integrality of the data in the C3D file. Our objective was to develop an open-source and multi-platform framework to read, write, modify and visualize data from any motion analysis systems using standard (C3D) and proprietary file formats (used by many companies producing motion capture systems). The Biomechanical ToolKit (BTK) was developed to provide cost-effective and efficient tools for the biomechanical community to easily deal with motion analysis data. A large panel of operations is available to read, modify and process data through C++ API, bindings for high-level languages (Matlab, Octave, and Python), and standalone application (Mokka). All these tools are open-source and cross-platform and run on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS X).},

	Abstract = {This paper describes results obtained in a preliminary investigation of a cooperative task consisting, for a pair of human operators, in moving a handle-shaped object between two predefined locations on a table. Seated, the operators use only upper body with single hand and arms in achieving this task. In a first step, each subject realized the task in a standalone mode. In a second step, pairs of subjects realized a similar task in a cooperative way. We used standalone results as a reference model to be compared with results obtained from cooperative experiments. Obtained results revealed that it is difficult to fit the minimum jerk model as a task motion characterization in both standalone and cooperative modes. However, we found an invariant velocity shape both for standalone and cooperation situations that can be used as a basic model for a robotic implementation. We noticed that the shape of the parabolic trajectory is always higher in cooperative tasks, although the weight of the object used in cooperative mode is exactly twice the one used in a standalone mode.

The basic idea is to switch continuously between two distinct extreme behaviors (leader and follower) for each individual, which creates an implicit bilateral coupling within the dyad. The physical collaborative interaction is then described only with two distinct homotopy time-functions that vary independently. These functions can likely describe the signature of a collaborative task. A virtual reality haptic set-up is used to assess the proposed theory.},

However, programming such interactive skills is a challenging task, as each interaction partner can have different timing or an alternative way of executing movements. In this paper, we propose to learn interaction skills by observing how two humans engage in a similar task. To this end, we introduce a new representation called Interaction Primitives. Interaction primitives build on the framework of dynamic motor primitives (DMPs) by maintaining a distribution over the parameters of the DMP. With this distribution, we can learn the inherent correlations of cooperative activities which allow us to infer the behavior of the partner and to participate in the cooperation. We will provide algorithms for synchronizing and adapting the behavior of humans and robots during joint physical activities.},

	Abstract = {abstract={Traditionally the leader or follower role of the robot in a human-robot collaborative task has to be predetermined. However, humans performing collaborative tasks can switch between or share the leader-follower roles effortlessly even in the absence of audio-visual cues. This is because humans are capable of developing a mutual understanding while performing the collaborative task. This paper proposes a framework to endow robots with a similar capability. Behavior of the robot is controlled by two types of controllers such as reactive and proactive controllers each giving the robot follower and leader characteristics respectively. Proactive actions are based on human motion prediction. We propose that the role of the robot can be governed by the confidence of prediction. Hence, the robot can determine its role during the task autonomously and dynamically. The framework is demonstrated and evaluated through a table-lifting task. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system improves the overall task performance.},

	Abstract = {It is common in the analysis of aggregate data in epidemiology that the variances of the aggregate observations are available. The analysis of such data leads to a measurement error situation, where the known variances of the measurement errors vary between the observations. Assuming multivariate normal distribution for the `true' observations and normal distributions for the measurement errors, we derive a simple EM algorithm for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the multivariate normal distributions. The results also facilitate the estimation of regression parameters between the variables as well as the `true' values of the observations. The approach is applied to re-estimate recent results of the WHO MONICA Project on cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, where the original estimation of the regression coefficients did not adjust for the regression attenuation caused by the measurement errors.

	Abstract = {Mixtures of multivariate t distributions provide a robust parametric extension to the fitting of data with respect to normal mixtures. In presence of some noise component, potential outliers or data with longer-than-normal tails, one way to broaden the model can be provided by considering t distributions. In this framework, the degrees of freedom can act as a robustness parameter, tuning the heaviness of the tails, and downweighting the effect of the outliers on the parameters estimation. The aim of this paper is to extend to mixtures of multivariate elliptical distributions some theoretical results about the likelihood maximization on constrained parameter spaces. Further, a constrained monotone algorithm implementing maximum likelihood mixture decomposition of multivariate t distributions is proposed, to achieve improved convergence capabilities and robustness. Monte Carlo numerical simulations and a real data study illustrate the better performance of the algorithm, comparing it to earlier proposals.},

	Abstract = {An S-estimator of multivariate location and scale minimizes the determinant of the covariance matrix, subject to a constraint on the magnitudes of the corresponding Mahalanobis distances. The relationship between S-estimators and w-estimators of multivariate location and scale can be used to calculate robust estimates of covariance matrices. Elemental subsets of observations are generated to derive initial estimates of means and covariances, and the w-estimator equations are then iterated until convergence to obtain the S-estimates. An example shows that converging to a (local) minimum from the initial estimates from the elemental subsets is an effective way of determining the overall minimum. None of the estimates gained from the elemental samples is close to the final solution. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This is a problem of interest in multiple robotics domains and applications, namely in Search and Rescue. The paper compares the Covariance Intersection (CI) and a class of Orthogonal Gnanadesikan-Kettenring (OGK) estimators. The performance of the two estimators is analyzed using the 2-norm of the covariance matrix. Simulation tests are presented showing that OGK tends to outperform CI when the correlation between sensors is significant and in the presence of outliers. The formal bounds found show that each of the two estimators outperforms the other depending on the region of the covariance matrix spectrum they are operating in. The conclusions point to the use covariance estimation systems with a hybrid of the two estimators.},

@article{Winter1995,
	Abstract = {The common denominator in the assessment of human balance and posture is the inverted pendulum model. If we focus on appropriate versions of the model we can use it to identify the gravitational and acceleration perturbations and pinpoint the motor mechanisms that can defend against any perturbation. We saw that in quiet standing an ankle strategy applies only in the \{AP\} direction and that a separate hip load/unload strategy by the hip abd/adductors is the totally dominant defence in the \{ML\} direction when standing with feet side by side. In other standing positions (tandem, or intermediate) the two mechanisms still work separately, but their roles reverse. In the tandem position \{ML\} balance is an ankle mechanism (invertors/evertors) while in the \{AP\} direction a hip load/unloading mechanism dominates. During initiation and termination of gait these two separate mechanisms control the trajectory of the \{COP\} to ensure the desired acceleration and deceleration of the COM. During initiation the initial acceleration of the \{COM\} forward towards the stance limb is achieved by a posterior and lateral movement of the \{COP\} towards the swing limb. After this release phase there is a sudden loading of the stance limb which shifts the \{COP\} to the stance limb. The \{COM\} is now accelerated forward and laterally towards the future position of the swinging foot. Also \{ML\} shifts of the \{COP\} were controlled by the hip abductors/adductors and all \{AP\} shifts were under the control of the ankle plantar/dorsiflexors. During termination the trajectory of both \{COM\} and \{COP\} reverse. As the final weight-bearing on the stance foot takes place the \{COM\} is passing forward along the medial border of that foot. Hyperactivity of that foot's plantarflexors takes the \{COP\} forward and when the final foot begins to bear weight the \{COP\} moves rapidly across and suddenly stops at a position ahead of the future position of the COM. Then the plantarflexors of both feet release and allow the \{COP\} to move posteriorly and approach the \{COM\} and meet it as quiet stance is achieved. The inverted pendulum model permitted us to understand the separate roles of the two mechanisms during these critical unbalancing and rebalancing periods. During walking the inverted pendulum model explained the dynamics of the balance of \{HAT\} in both the \{AP\} and \{ML\} directions. Here the model includes the couple due to the acceleration of the weight-bearing hip as well as gravitational perturbations. The exclusive control of \{AP\} balance and posture are the hip extensors and flexors, while in the \{ML\} direction the dominant control is with the hip abductors with very minor adductor involvement. At the ankle the inverted pendulum model sees the \{COM\} passing forward along the medial border to the weight-bearing foot. The model predicts that during single support the body is falling forward and being accelerated medially towards the future position of the swing foot. The model predicts an insignificant role of the ankle invertors/evertors in the \{ML\} control. Rather, the future position of the swing foot is the critical variable or more specifically the lateral displacement from the \{COM\} at the start of single support. The position is actually under the control of the hip abd/adductors during the previous early swing phase. The critical importance of the hip abductors/adductors in balance during all phases of standing and walking is now evident. This separate mechanism is important from a neural control perspective and clinically it focuses major attention on therapy and potential problems with some surgical procedures. On the other hand the minuscule role of the ankle invertors/evertors is important to note. Except for the tandem standing position these muscles have negligible involvement in balance control. },

	Abstract = {Principles of muscle coordination in gait have been based largely on analyses of body motion, ground reaction force and \{EMG\} measurements. However, data from dynamical simulations provide a cause-effect framework for analyzing these measurements; for example, Part I (Gait Posture, in press) of this two-part review described how force generation in a muscle affects the acceleration and energy flow among the segments. This Part \{II\} reviews the mechanical and coordination concepts arising from analyses of simulations of walking. Simple models have elucidated the basic multisegmented ballistic and passive mechanics of walking. Dynamical models driven by net joint moments have provided clues about coordination in healthy and pathological gait. Simulations driven by muscle excitations have highlighted the partial stability afforded by muscles with their viscoelastic-like properties and the predictability of walking performance when minimization of metabolic energy per unit distance is assumed. When combined with neural control models for exciting motoneuronal pools, simulations have shown how the integrative properties of the neuro-musculo-skeletal systems maintain a stable gait. Other analyses of walking simulations have revealed how individual muscles contribute to trunk support and progression. Finally, we discuss how biomechanical models and simulations may enhance our understanding of the mechanics and muscle function of walking in individuals with gait impairments. },

	Abstract = {revious attempts to use inverse dynamics solutions in direct dynamics simulations have failed to replicate the input data of the inverse dynamics problem. Measurement and derivative estimation error, different inverse dynamics and direct dynamics models, and numerical integration error have all been suggested as possible causes of inverse dynamics simulation failure. However, using a biomechanical model of the type typically used in gait analysis applications for inverse dynamics calculations of joint moments, we produce a direct dynamics simulation that exactly matches the measured movement pattern used as input to the inverse dynamic problem. This example of successful inverse dynamics simulation demonstrates that although different inverse dynamics and direct dynamics models may lead to inverse dynamics simulation failure, measurement and derivative estimation error do not. In addition, inverse dynamics simulation failure due to numerical integration errors can be avoided. Further, we demonstrate that insufficient control signal dimensionality (i.e., freedom of the control signals to take on different ``shapes''), a previously unrecognized cause of inverse dynamics simulation failure, will cause inverse dynamics simulation failure even with a perfect model and perfect data, regardless of sampling frequency.},

	Abstract = {A multibody methodology for systematic construction of a two-dimensional biomechanical model of a human body is presented, aimed at effective determination of the muscle forces and joint reaction forces in the lower extremities during sagittal plane movements such as vertical jump, standing long jump or jumping down from a height. While the hip, knee and ankle joints are modeled as enforced directly by the muscle forces applied to the foot, shank, thigh and pelvis at the muscle attachment points, the actuation of the other joints is simplified to the torques representing the respective muscle action. The developed formulation is applicable to both the flying and support phases, enhanced by an effective scheme for the determination of reaction forces exclusively in the lower extremity joints. The determination of reactions from the ground is also provided. The problem of muscle force redundancy in the lower extremities is solved by applying the pseudoinverse method, with post-processing procedures used to assure the muscle being tensile. Results of the inverse dynamics analysis of vertical jump are reported.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties in joint torque estimates derived through inverse dynamics. The analysis considered most of the quantifiable sources of inaccuracy in the input variables for inverse dynamics solutions (i.e., errors in body segment parameter estimates, joint center of rotation locations, force plate measurements, motion capture system measurements, and segment angle calculations due to skin movement artifacts). Estimates of inaccuracies were synthesized from existing literature and from a complementary set of experimental data. The analysis was illustrated and tested via an inverse dynamic analysis of gait, in which kinematic and force plate data from 10 adult subjects were recorded and used to calculate the planar (flexion/extension) torques at the ankle, knee, hip, elbow, shoulder, and bottom of torso. The results suggested that the uncertainties in torque estimates derived through inverse dynamics can be substantial (6--232% of the estimated torque magnitude); the time-varying uncertainty patterns do not resemble the torque profiles, and the magnitudes are smaller for more distal joints; the main contributors to these uncertainties were identified to be the inaccuracies in estimated segment angles and body segment parameters. The empirical test also showed that the uncertainty predicted by a more conservative (smaller) set of inaccuracy estimates was comparable to the statistical (3σ) bound of the error. Implications in terms of how inverse dynamics solutions should be interpreted and improved, along with the limitations of the current work, are discussed. },

@article{Riemer2008,
	Abstract = {The accuracy of joint torques calculated from inverse dynamics methods is strongly dependent upon errors in body segment motion profiles, which arise from two sources of noise: the motion capture system and movement artifacts of skin-mounted markers. The current study presents a method to increase the accuracy of estimated joint torques through the optimization of the angular position data used to describe these segment motions. To compute these angular data, we formulated a constrained nonlinear optimization problem with a cost function that minimizes the difference between the known ground reaction forces (GRFs) and the \{GRF\} calculated via a top-down inverse dynamics solution. To evaluate this approach, we constructed idealized error-free reference movements (of squatting and lifting) that produced a set of known ``true'' motions and associated true joint torques and GRF. To simulate real-world inaccuracies in motion data, these true motions were perturbed by artificial noise. We then applied our approach to these noise-induced data to determine optimized motions and related joint torques. To evaluate the efficacy of the optimization approach compared to traditional (bottom-up or top-down) inverse dynamics approaches, we computed the root mean square error (RMSE) values of joint torques derived from each approach relative to the expected true joint torques. Compared to traditional approaches, the optimization approach reduced the \{RMSE\} by 54% to 79%. Average reduction due to our method was 65%; previous methods only achieved an overall reduction of 30%. These results suggest that significant improvement in the accuracy of joint torque calculations can be achieved using this approach. },

	Abstract = {This paper examined if an electromyography (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model of the human knee could be used to predict knee moments, calculated using inverse dynamics, across a varied range of dynamic contractile conditions. Muscle--tendon lengths and moment arms of 13 muscles crossing the knee joint were determined from joint kinematics using a three-dimensional anatomical model of the lower limb. Muscle activation was determined using a second-order discrete non-linear model using rectified and low-pass filtered \{EMG\} as input. A modified Hill-type muscle model was used to calculate individual muscle forces using activation and muscle tendon lengths as inputs. The model was calibrated to six individuals by altering a set of physiologically based parameters using mathematical optimisation to match the net flexion/extension (FE) muscle moment with those measured by inverse dynamics. The model was calibrated for each subject using 5 different tasks, including passive and active \{FE\} in an isokinetic dynamometer, running, and cutting manoeuvres recorded using three-dimensional motion analysis. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the \{FE\} moments, estimated via inverse dynamics, from over 200 isokinetic dynamometer, running and sidestepping tasks. The inverse dynamics joint moments were predicted with an average \{R2\} of 0.91 and mean residual error of ∼12 Nm. A re-calibration of only the EMG-to-activation parameters revealed \{FE\} moments prediction across weeks of similar accuracy. Changing the muscle model to one that is more physiologically correct produced better predictions. The modelling method presented represents a good way to estimate in vivo muscle forces during movement tasks. },

A system to estimate the operating force based on ground reaction force and human behavior has been developed. However, it is necessary to measure the human behavior (position, velocity, and acceleration) of 17 points on the body with the conventional human dynamics model. Therefore, the system is extremely expensive and not practical, because of large number of sensors. In addition, fewer sensor units worsen the estimation accuracy of the operating force. In order to improve the estimation accuracy of the operating force, it is important to identify positions of center-of-gravity and masses of links. Thus, this paper presents the novel human dynamics model estimating the operating force and parameters using extended Kalman filter based on human behavior with only 6 sensor units and ground reaction force. Improvement of the estimation accuracy is confirmed by experiments.},

The approach is now adapted for angular velocity data. The segmented motions are recognized via HMM models. The segmentation and recognition results of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated with experiments. Auto segmentation of each motion and recognition of motion patterns are verified using angular velocity data obtained by IMU sensors and the Wii remote.

	Abstract = {The human body is modeled as a humanoid robot with 34 dof and 15 links. The inverse dynamic model of the robot is linear in relation to 10 standard physical inertial parameters for each link which are the mass, the 6 inertia matrix coefficients and the 3 center of mass coordinates. For robotics control or simulation applications, a minimum number of b base parameters, b <; 150, can be identified by linear LS techniques using motion capture and foot/ground contact force/torque data measurements. But some base parameters are not well identified due to measuring errors and poor excitation. They have no statistical significant values and they can lose their physical meaning. Because these parameters have little contribution in the measured force/torque they can be eliminated from the model to calculate a subset of significant base parameters called the essential parameters [1], [2], [3]. For medical applications the physical anatomical meaningful values are needed for the 150 standard parameters of the 15 segments of the human body model, not only a minimal set of parameters. Based on the essential parameters we propose to calculate the LS solution with SVD factorization, which is the closest in 2 norm of a set of a priori anatomic values given by literature database. This solution keeps both the same minimum norm error given by the essential parameters and the physical anatomical meaning of the a priori values when the measuring noise and errors are small. Experimental results are presented and discussed.},

These larger models may include spherical in addition to revolute joints. We examine the effects on segmentation performance due to motion representation choice, and compare the segmentation efficacy when Cartesian or joint angle data is used. The approach is tested on whole body human motion data modeled with a 42DoF kinematic model. The results indicate that Cartesian data seems to correspond most closely to the human evaluation of segment points. The experiments also demonstrate the efficacy of the segmentation approach for large kinematic models and a variety of human motions.},

Based on our previous works, we propose a real-time software that allows to estimate the whole-body segment parameters, and to visualize the progresses of the completion of the identification. The visualization is used as a feedback to optimize the excitation and thus the identification results. The method is experimentally tested.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We experimentally identify the human body dynamics from motion capture data and contact force measurements. We make use of the 6 base-link equations to write the identification model. We have shown that the obtained system is sufficient to estimate the whole base inertial parameters. The method is computationally efficient; and allows to identify the pure inertial parameters without transmission, friction considerations. However finding persistent exciting trajectories is a drawback of the method. In this paper we put emphasis in describing persistent exciting trajectories that are suitable to obtain accurate results. We propose a method to automatically select the set of motions used for the identification in order to optimize the computation time and the accuracy of the identified parameters. For the experiments we make use of gymnastic motions. Each of the 3 subjects -of different body conformations- perform 29 types of motions. The identification method and the automatic motions selection method are both applied to obtain the inertial parameters of one subject. },

	Abstract = {Identification results dramatically depend on the excitation properties of the motion used to sample the identification model. Strategies to define persistent exciting trajectories have been developed for manipulator robots with few DOF. However they can not easily be extended to humanoid systems and humans due to the important number of DOF; and empirical knowledge is often used to generate and select persistent exciting motions. In this paper we propose a method to choose persistent exciting motions from an existing dataset in order to optimize both the identification results and the computation time. This method is based on the use of the identification model of legged systems obtained from the base-link equations. Instead of using well-established consideration on the condition number of the regressor matrix, the method uses a decomposition of the regressor into elementary sub-regressors and the computation of the condition number for each. A selection rule is then proposed. The overall method is experimentally tested to identify the human body inertial parameters using a data-set of 40 motions. Comparative results obtained from different combinations of motions are given.},

	Abstract = {Support surface perturbations are a common paradigm for the study of balance and postural control. Forces and moments acquired from force plates mounted on, or within, the moving surface will contain components resulting from the inertia of the force plate itself. These force plate inertial components must be removed in order to accurately estimate forces resulting from contact with the force plate. This is particularly important when these contact forces are to be used in further calculations, such as an inverse dynamics analysis of joint kinetics. An estimate of the \{FPIC\} can be derived using the kinematics of the moving surface and the inertial properties of the force plate. This technique allowed for a reduction of up to 85% of the peak and integrated \{FPIC\} acquired from \{AMTI\} (OR6--7) force plates during translations of 0.1 m, and surface rotations of 10$\,^{\circ}$, using a ramp stimulus of 150 ms duration. },

	Abstract = {We describe a new physics engine tailored to model-based control. Multi-joint dynamics are represented in generalized coordinates and computed via recursive algorithms. Contact responses are computed via efficient new algorithms we have developed, based on the modern velocity-stepping approach which avoids the difficulties with spring-dampers. Models are specified using either a high-level C++ API or an intuitive XML file format. A built-in compiler transforms the user model into an optimized data structure used for runtime computation. The engine can compute both forward and inverse dynamics. The latter are well-defined even in the presence of contacts and equality constraints. The model can include tendon wrapping as well as actuator activation states (e.g. pneumatic cylinders or muscles). To facilitate optimal control applications and in particular sampling and finite differencing, the dynamics can be evaluated for different states and controls in parallel. Around 400,000 dynamics evaluations per second are possible on a 12-core machine, for a 3D homanoid with 18 dofs and 6 active contacts. We have already used the engine in a number of control applications. It will soon be made publicly available.},

Realizing the complexity of human upper limb, the study is limited to human upper limb, consisting of 3 glenohumeral joints (abduction-adduction, flexion-extension, and rotation) and elbow joint (flexionextension). In this paper the rehabilitation robotic system is proposed to assist a patient to train his hand movements to a desired position by considering other parameters such as speed and joint torque. In this system, each movement of the glenohumeral joints are scheduled based on the feedback signal obtained from the respective muscle groups through EMG signal interface. The kinematic model is proposed based on the literature survey and assumptions are made to reduce the complexity. Denavit-Hartenberg method is used for the positional analysis to determine the end position in 3D space while the Lagrange-Euler method is used for the dynamic analysis. A PID computed torque controller was designed by utilizing the equation of motion. The purpose of the controller is to compensate the dynamical imperfection and the presence of disturbance. The project is developed using MATLAB SimMechanics, in which human arm and rehabilitation robot is modeled.},

We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.},

Similarly, we define the state estimation problem as the problem of computing the system positions and velocities. In the present paper we propose a framework for simultaneous state and dynamics estimation. The estimation is framed in a Bayesian framework and a suitable Bayesian prior is defined to guarantee the physical consistency of the obtained estimation. The Bayesian posterior makes use of all available measurements which include encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers, force and torque sensors. The proposed theoretical framework is validated both on simulation and on the iCub humanoid. The software that implements the theoretical framework is realised with an open-source license.},

	Abstract = {We describe a humanoid robot platform --- the iCub --- which was designed to support collaborative research in cognitive development through autonomous exploration and social interaction. The motivation for this effort is the conviction that significantly greater impact can be leveraged by adopting an open systems policy for software and hardware development. This creates the need for a robust humanoid robot that offers rich perceptuo-motor capabilities with many degrees of freedom, a cognitive capacity for learning and development, a software architecture that encourages reuse &amp; easy integration, and a support infrastructure that fosters collaboration and sharing of resources. The iCub satisfies all of these needs in the guise of an open-system platform which is freely available and which has attracted a growing community of users and developers. To date, twenty iCubs each comprising approximately 5000 mechanical and electrical parts have been delivered to several research labs in Europe and to one in the USA. },

	Abstract = {Wearable robots based on soft materials will augment mobility and performance of the host without restricting natural kinematics. Such wearable robots will need soft sensors to monitor the movement of the wearer and robot outside the lab. Until now wearable soft sensors have not demonstrated significant mechanical robustness nor been systematically characterized for human motion studies of walking and running. Here, we present the design and systematic characterization of a soft sensing suit for monitoring hip, knee, and ankle sagittal plane joint angles. We used hyper-elastic strain sensors based on microchannels of liquid metal embedded within elastomer, but refined their design with the use of discretized stiffness gradients to improve mechanical durability. We found that these robust sensors could stretch up to 396% of their original lengths, would restrict the wearer by less than 0.17% of any given joint's torque, had gauge factor sensitivities of greater than 2.2, and exhibited less than 2% change in electromechanical specifications through 1500 cycles of loading--unloading. We also evaluated the accuracy and variability of the soft sensing suit by comparing it with joint angle data obtained through optical motion capture. The sensing suit had root mean square (RMS) errors of less than 5$\,^{\circ}$ for a walking speed of 0.89 m/s and reached a maximum RMS error of 15$\,^{\circ}$ for a running speed of 2.7 m/s. Despite the deviation of absolute measure, the relative repeatability of the sensing suit's joint angle measurements were statistically equivalent to that of optical motion capture at all speeds. We anticipate that wearable soft sensing will also have applications beyond wearable robotics, such as in medical diagnostics and in human--computer interaction.},

	Abstract = {Motion sensing has played an important role in the study of human biomechanics as well as the entertainment industry. Although existing technologies, such as optical or inertial based motion capture systems, have relatively high accuracy in detecting body motions, they still have inherent limitations with regards to mobility and wearability. In this paper, we present a soft motion sensing suit for measuring lower extremity joint motion. The sensing suit prototype includes a pair of elastic tights and three hyperelastic strain sensors. The strain sensors are made of silicone elastomer with embedded microchannels filled with conductive liquid. To form a sensing suit, these sensors are attached at the hip, knee, and ankle areas to measure the joint angles in the sagittal plane. The prototype motion sensing suit has significant potential as an autonomous system that can be worn by individuals during many activities outside the laboratory, from running to rock climbing. In this study we characterize the hyperelastic sensors in isolation to determine their mechanical and electrical responses to strain, and then demonstrate the sensing capability of the integrated suit in comparison with a ground truth optical motion capture system. Using simple calibration techniques, we can accurately track joint angles and gait phase. Our efforts result in a calculated trade off: with a maximum error less than 8%, the sensing suit does not track joints as accurately as optical motion capture, but its wearability means that it is not constrained to use only in a lab.},

	Abstract = {This study investigated the validity of the top-down approach of inverse dynamics analysis in fast and large rotational movements of the trunk about three orthogonal axes of the pelvis for nine male collegiate students. The maximum angles of the upper trunk relative to the pelvis were approximately 47$\,^{\circ}$, 49$\,^{\circ}$, 32$\,^{\circ}$, and 55$\,^{\circ}$ for lateral bending, flexion, extension, and axial rotation, respectively, with maximum angular velocities of 209$\,^{\circ}$/s, 201$\,^{\circ}$/s, 145$\,^{\circ}$/s, and 288$\,^{\circ}$/s, respectively. The pelvic moments about the axes during the movements were determined using the top-down and bottom-up approaches of inverse dynamics and compared between the two approaches. Three body segment inertial parameter sets were estimated using anthropometric data sets (Ae et al., Biomechanism 11, 1992; De Leva, J Biomech, 1996; Dumas et al., J Biomech, 2007). The root-mean-square errors of the moments and the absolute errors of the peaks of the moments were generally smaller than 10 N·m. The results suggest that the pelvic moment in motions involving fast and large trunk movements can be determined with a certain level of validity using the top-down approach in which the trunk is modeled as two or three rigid-link segments.},

This alternative is based on unknown-input observers which allow real-time estimation of joint torques and angular velocities from measurements of the angular positions. To design the aforementioned observer, a nonlinear state-space dynamical descriptor model is proposed. The descriptor model is then written into the form of a Takagi--Sugeno (T--S) model, from which a T--S observer in the descriptor form is designed. Then, convergence of the estimation errors (in position, velocities and torques) is established using a quadratic Lyapunov function through LMI conditions.

	Abstract = {In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the local compliance of tactile arrays exploiting global measurements from a single force and torque sensor. The proposed procedure exploits a transformation matrix (describing the relative position between the local tactile elements and the global force/torque measurements) to define a linear regression problem on the unknown local stiffness. Experiments have been conducted on the foot of the iCub robot, sensorized with a single force/torque sensor and a tactile array of 250 tactile elements (taxels) on the foot sole. Results show that a simple calibration procedure can be employed to estimate the stiffness parameters of virtual springs over a tactile array and to use these model to predict normal forces exerted on the array based only on the tactile feedback. Leveraging on previous works [1] the proposed procedure does not necessarily need a-priori information on the transformation matrix of the taxels which can be directly estimated from available measurements.,

	Abstract = {In inverse dynamics computations, the accuracy of the solution strongly depends on the accuracy of the input data. In particular, estimated joint moments are highly sensitive to uncertainties in acceleration data. The aim of the present work was to improve classical inverse dynamics computations by providing an accurate estimation of accelerations. Accelerations are usually calculated from noise-polluted position data using numerical double differentiation, which amplifies measurement noise. The objective of the present paper is to use all available imperfect position and force measurements to extract optimum acceleration estimations. A weighted least-squares optimisation approach is used to provide optimal acceleration distributions most consistent with position and force data, and which account for the propagation of measurement uncertainties. The task chosen for comparing the solution methodology with other classical methods is a typical experimental postural movement, consisting in upper limb swings from an upright stance. The proposed method delivers a set of optimal accelerations well consistent with all available measurements. It also leads to an accurate prediction of ground reactions and it produces no residual moment at the top-most segment.},

A sequential unbiased estimate for a parameter is obtained, such that when the sequential test terminates after $i$ observations, the estimate is a function of a sufficient statistic for the parameter with respect to these observations.

Although it is a well-established technique, its main limitation is the lack of estimation of real-time kinetics information such as forces and torques during the motion capture. In this paper, we present a novel approach for a human soft wearable force tracking for the simultaneous estimation of whole-body forces along with the motion. The early stage of our framework encompasses traditional passive marker based methods, inertial and contact force sensor modalities and harnesses a probabilistic computational technique for estimating dynamic quantities, originally proposed in the domain of humanoid robot control. We present experimental analysis on subjects performing a two degrees-of-freedom bowing task, and we estimate the motion and kinetics quantities. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. We discuss the possible use of this technique in the design of a novel soft wearable force tracking device and its potential applications.},
