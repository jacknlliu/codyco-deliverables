\section{Conclusions and Future Works}
%
This report presents the progresses towards the implementation of 
learning how to stand up with the help of a human caregiver.
Presented results focus on: (1) human dynamics estimation while is physically 
interacting with a robot; (2) robot motion control for unassisted standing up 
motions. 

Human dynamics estimation is of pivotal importance
for a control design aimed at considering the \emph{human in the loop}
during physical human robot interaction. 
It provides in real-time the robot with the human force feedback
that could be used either as a tool for \emph{reactive} human-robot collaboration
(implying a robot reactive control) and, in a long-term perspective,
for \emph{predictive} collaboration, for enhancing remarkably the interaction naturalness.
Thus, the next step consists in developing a controller to endow the 
robot with the ability to adapt and adjust the interaction strategy.
