\section{Project objectives}

\subsection{Overview}

The specificity of CoDyCo relies on the fact that the progress beyond the state of the art is guided by the yearly implementation on the iCub humanoid. Within this context, iCub is a peculiar platform being the only humanoid integrating whole-body distributed force and tactile sensors. In this sense CoDyCo specific objectives were to design and implement the control of whole-body posture during physical human robot interaction. Other long term objectives involve setting up the necessary infrastructure (human experimental protocols, software infrastructure, learning and control specifications) for leveraging the activities in previous years. 

The aim of CoDyCo was to advance the control and cognitive understanding about robust, goal- directed whole-body motion interaction with multiple contacts. When the CoDyCo consortium wrote the project milestones, our goal was to go beyond traditional approaches. First, we wanted to propose methodologies for performing coordinated interaction tasks with complex systems. Second, to combine planning and compliance to deal with predictable and unpredictable events and contacts. Finally, we wanted to do something to validate theoretical advances in real-world interaction scenarios.

\subsection{Overview WP2: what we learn from humans }

To guide robotic developments within Codyco, we performed a series of human behavioural experiments. We recorded human subjects undergoing a set of whole body motions involving contacts with different types of environment. The set included balancing with multiple rigid contacts, goal directed actions involving supportive hand contacts while balancing on surfaces of different stability, learning to use non-rigid contacts and human assistive contact. These experiments, and the resulting data were essential for the robotic developments and provided the consortium with the guiding principles for designing robot control policies and principles for physical interaction between the robots, humans, and the environment.

and provided the consortium with the guiding principles for designing robot control policies 
and principles for physical interaction between the robots, humans, and the environment. 


\subsection{Overview WP1: tools for describing the motion}
To facilitate collaboration between CoDyCo partners, we set out from the very beginning of the project, to develop a common set of software tools shared amongst all members.  The tools we developed include methods for modelling, simulating and calibrating whole body robot behaviours with contact interactions, but importantly also for modeling human motion with contact interaction. We believe that there are underlying principles that may be applied to understanding both human and robot motion, and having a common set of tools to work with helps us draw those connections.   

\subsection{Overview WP5: porting the results on the iCub}

The project achievements were validated on the iCub. iCub is a humanoid robot with the size of a 4 years old child. The robot is equipped with numerous sensors that makes it unique: it has inertial sensing in the head, which acts like our vestibular system; then force/torque sensing in the arms, legs and feet, and an artificial skin consisting of distributed tactile sensors. Thanks to all these sensors, we can compute in real-time the forces that the robot exchange with the human or the environment when there is a contact on its body.

The experimental validation of the controllers developed during the CoDyCo journey has required not only a deep understanding of the theoretical framework, but also a clear insight into the iCub software infrastructure and into the so called low-level. In fact, controllers usually provide the robot with high-level objectives such as balancing and compliance during user interaction. These high level objectives must be translated into nested, consequent objectives until the commands we send to the robot motors. Hence, actuation modelling, tuning, efficient controller implementation, and iterative optimization of the obtained performances have been key ingredients for the success of the CoDyCo demos. More importantly, the implementation of control algorithms on the iCub platform has served as a tool for the theoretical investigations that we had to pursue. For example, after implementing state -of-the art control algorithms we observed that some of these were simply unstable. We then focused on how to modify these algorithms to obtain stability, a fundamental property for whole body controllers.

\subsection{Overview WP3: the controller that we use}

Controlling humanoids in situations where multiple contacts have to be made with the environment in order to maintain or improve balance is a complex problem. This complexity is mostly due to two factors. The first one relates to the complexity of the system and of its interaction with the environment. Indeed the problem has to be looked at from a dynamics point of view where interaction forces can be accounted for. This requires an accurate knowledge of the robot model,  the fine-tuning of low-level control loops, a correct estimation of interaction forces with the environment and more generally of the system's state as well as the capability to strictly respect constraints acting on the system while achieving several tasks at the same time. The second factor is related to the hybrid nature of humanoids. Humanoids are intrinsically underactuated systems which can compensate for underactuation through unilateral physical interactions with their environment. Unilaterality means that contacts can be made and broken. Deciding when and where to break/make contact is a complex problem as it involves a preview of the effect of this discrete decision over a time horizon. In CoDyCo we  provide robust and generic control approaches to tackle the complexity of this control problem.

\subsection{Overview WP4: why and where we use learning}

Autonomous robots that can assist humans in situations of daily life have been a long standing vision of robotics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive sciences. A first step towards this goal is to create robots that can learn tasks triggered by visual stimuli from higher level instruction. However, learning techniques have yet to live up to this promise as only few methods manage to scale to high-dimensional manipulator or humanoid robots.We investigate the key ingredients for learning motor skills in robotics including both manipulation of static and dynamic objects that are perceived using vision or tactile sensing. The resulting approach relies on a representation of motor skills by parameterized motor primitive policies acting as building blocks of movement generation, and a learned task execution module that transforms these movements into motor commands. We discuss task-appropriate learning approaches for imitation learning, model learning and reinforcement learning for robots with many degrees of freedom that perceive the manipulated objects using robot vision or tactile sensing. Empirical evaluations on our iCub  illustrate the effectiveness and applicability to learning control when making and breaking contact with the environment.

\subsection{Overview: conclusion}

After four years of intensive activities, the CoDyCo consortium achieved an outstanding number of advances in the field of controlling and cognitive understanding about robust, goal-directed whole-body motion interaction with multiple contacts. Thanks to experiments with humans coordinated by Jan Babic at JSI and modeled by Mike Mistry at UB, we were able to develop novel metrics to understand when humans proficiently exploit whole-body distributed contacts. Theoretical advances in the field of control achieved by Vincent Padois at UPMC, gave robots the ability to control their whole-body posture by means of contact force regulation. Learning strategies have been coordinated by Jan Peters at TUD and gave robots the ability to adapt their control actions on the basis of human requirements. Implementation on the iCub humanoid have validated the utility of the conducted research on real-world scenarios.

\section{Progress overview and contribution to the research field}

All the CoDyCo objectives have been attained. Here is a list of the CoDyCo achievements. 
\begin{enumerate}
 
\item First year achievements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design and implementation of an open-source simulator environment for the iCub and digital human whole-body motion simulation. After a consortium shared effort, it was decided to adopt Gazebo \url{http://gazebosim.org} as a basis for the simulator. Gazebo offers a structured software interface (plugins) which was used to export a YARP interface to simulated robots. The Gazebo-YARP plugin source code is available on github, at the address \url{https://github.com/robotology/gazebo_yarp_plugins}. The use of Gazebo was chosen on the basis of a public survey \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.7050} and on the results of a discussion conducted in Paris during a workshop organized at ISIR.

\item Design and implementation of a whole-body software abstraction layer \url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco/tree/master/src/libraries/wholeBodyInterface} which represents the backbone of the CoDyCo software architecture, interface and module structure.

\item Design and definition of human experimental protocols and simplified models for whole-body motion with multiple contacts. After an extensive literature review (D2.1), JSI conducted preliminary studies on examining functional role of supportive hand contact while balancing.

\item Design and test of state of the art control strategies for whole-body motion with multiple contacts. Realization of a solver for the whole-body reactive control that provides an expressive and rich description of the control problem as well as an efficient way of solving it. Implementation of the results in a whole-body control validation scenario in presence of multiple contacts. 

\item Preliminary studies on learning methods suitable for tasks that involve many uncertain contacts. Design of fast regression methods that can deal with well structured input noise. Methods for learning how to combine elementary control tasks.
\end{enumerate}

\item Second year achievements: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Design, implementation and maintenance of the whole-body control software infrastructure. The infrastructure consists of several modules which significantly improved the controller accuracy and robustness thanks to: a module for whole-body torques estimation, a module for force/torque sensors calibration, a module for whole-body dynamics identification and a module for dynamics estimation. 

\item Design of experimental protocols and data collection of experiments for studying humans in multi-contact interaction with the environment. This includes an experiment on hand-contact assisted balancing, a metric for whole-body stability characterisation, an experiment of human robot physical interaction and a study on collaborative human-robot physical interaction.

\item Design and simulation of whole-body control strategies in presence of non-rigid contacts. Experiments on postural control under multiple environmental contacts while controlling the operational space dynamics. 

\item Development of a theoretical framework for representing movement primitives within probabilistic contexts. Design of a model-free probabilistic representation for simultaneous representation of kinematic and force trajectories. Preliminary studies on the problem of learning strategies to adapt temporal activation of low-level primitives and to deal with interferences in combining multiple whole-body tasks. 

\item Implementation of the second year validation scenario consisting in whole-body motion control subject to postural, contact and goal-directed (Cartesian) constraints.

\end{enumerate}

\item Third year achievements:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Release of an open-source software for contact compliance estimation.

\item Release of an open-source software for floating-base estimation.

\item Models of human interaction with compliant contacts.

\item Definition and solution of the theoretical framework for balancing on compliant contacts.

\item Learning models of simultaneous use of elementary tasks and co-articulation of multiple tasks.

\item Implementation of the third validation scenario: balancing on compliant or dynamical contacts.

\end{enumerate}

\item Fourth year achievements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Real-time estimation of human and robot kinematics and dynamics during physical human-robot interaction. 

\item Experiments of human whole-body dynamics during goal-directed tasks with contacts. A memory task and an inhibitory Stroop task were performed to explore cognitive control over balance in novel challenging conditions.

\item Control algorithm based on incremental task compatibility optimization to allow incremental adaptation of operational tasks during whole-body control. 

\item Probabilistic movement representation of skills to learn task prioritization from human demonstrations. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Management}

The CoDyCo project was managed successfully. Management activities included three amendments, smoothly organized by the consortium and the project officer. Specifically, an amendment was necessary to include INRIA among the partners. Finances were smoothly organized with no significant modifications with respect to the original plan. Several scientific publications have been achieved within the project. Dissemination events included summer schools, TV shows participations and invited talks at scientific events.

  combination of a CoDyCo technology (tactile foot soles and real-time
  inverse dynamics computations) and a commercial technology
  (XSENS-MVN wearable motion capture system). The resulting technology
  is a fully wearable force and motion tracking system.}

The CoDyCo project is the prerequisite for impacting on industrial applications.
Its results and in particular those related to physical human-robot collaboration
fostered a number of applications related in the field of healthcare, rehabilitation
and safety at work (i.e. ergonomy). These ideas will be further investigated in 
the project An.Dy - Advancing Anticipatory Behaviors in Dyadic Human-Robot Collaboration,
which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 731540.

Moreover, an industrial collaboration between IIT and XSENS started at the end of 
2015. This collaboration (see Figure \ref{fig:XSENS_IIT}) combines technologies
developed by IIT (the inverse dynamics algorithm and the tactile sensor) 
with commercial technologies (XSENS - MVN wearable motion capture system)
to obtain a new real-time system for simultaneous force and motion tracking.
