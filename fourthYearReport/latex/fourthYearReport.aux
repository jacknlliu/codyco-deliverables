In both tasks participants actively explored a target and distractor surface simultaneously using 2 digits; the digits were either on one hand or two hands, expected to result in more or less crosstalk. In the 2-IFC task (A), participants identified the rougher of a pair of target stimuli and were instructed to ignore the distracter. The red circles and line indicate group (N=12) average performance when the fine surfaced target was paired with various coarse distractor surfaces; a fine distractor depresses accuracy more than a coarse distractor. The blue circles and line show behaviour with the coarse target; a coarse distractor depresses accuracy more than does a fine one. The bar graph summarising mean slope across participants shows the distraction effect is greater in the one hand condition. In the AME task (B), participants rated the roughness of target surfaces while instructed to ignore the simultaneously touched distractor. The graph at the top of figure 1b shows mean ratings for each target surface. The blue crosses and squares show mean ratings for each target surface with a coarse distractor surface.
