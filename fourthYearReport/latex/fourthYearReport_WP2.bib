@article{Cohen2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND This study asked whether older adults were more likely than younger adults to err in the initial direction of their anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) prior to a step (indicating a motor program error), whether initial motor program errors accounted for reaction time differences for step initiation, and whether initial motor program errors were linked to inhibitory failure. METHODS In a stepping task with choice reaction time and simple reaction time conditions, we measured forces under the feet to quantify APA onset and step latency and we used body kinematics to quantify forward movement of center of mass and length of first step. RESULTS Trials with APA errors were almost three times as common for older adults as for younger adults, and they were nine times more likely in choice reaction time trials than in simple reaction time trials. In trials with APA errors, step latency was delayed, correlation between APA onset and step latency was diminished, and forward motion of the center of mass prior to the step was increased. Participants with more APA errors tended to have worse Stroop interference scores, regardless of age. CONCLUSIONS The results support the hypothesis that findings of slow choice reaction time step initiation in older adults are attributable to inclusion of trials with incorrect initial motor preparation and that these errors are caused by deficits in response inhibition. By extension, the results also suggest that mixing of trials with correct and incorrect initial motor preparation might explain apparent choice reaction time slowing with age in upper limb tasks.},

@article{Robinovitch2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls in elderly people are a major health burden, especially in the long-term care environment. Yet little objective evidence is available for how and why falls occur in this population. We aimed to provide such evidence by analysing real-life falls in long-term care captured on video.

METHODS: We did this observational study between April 20, 2007, and June 23, 2010, in two long-term care facilities in British Columbia, Canada. Digital video cameras were installed in common areas (dining rooms, lounges, hallways). When a fall occurred, facility staff completed an incident report and contacted our teams so that we could collect video footage. A team reviewed each fall video with a validated questionnaire that probed the cause of imbalance and activity at the time of falling. We then tested whether differences existed in the proportion of participants falling due to the various causes, and while engaging in various activities, with generalised linear models, repeated measures logistic regression, and log-linear Poisson regression.

FINDINGS: We captured 227 falls from 130 individuals (mean age 78 years, SD 10). The most frequent cause of falling was incorrect weight shifting, which accounted for 41{\%} (93 of 227) of falls, followed by trip or stumble (48, 21{\%}), hit or bump (25, 11{\%}), loss of support (25, 11{\%}), and collapse (24, 11{\%}). Slipping accounted for only 3{\%} (six) of falls. The three activities associated with the highest proportion of falls were forward walking (54 of 227 falls, 24{\%}), standing quietly (29 falls, 13{\%}), and sitting down (28 falls, 12{\%}). Compared with previous reports from the long-term care setting, we identified a higher occurrence of falls during standing and transferring, a lower occurrence during walking, and a larger proportion due to centre-of-mass perturbations than base-of-support perturbations.

INTERPRETATION: By providing insight into the sequences of events that most commonly lead to falls, our results should lead to more valid and effective approaches for balance assessment and fall prevention in long-term care.

@article{Sparto2013,
abstract = {Postural dual-task studies have demonstrated effects of various executive function components on gait and postural control in older adults. The purpose of the study was to explore the role of inhibition during lateral step initiation. Forty older adults participated (range 70-94 yr). Subjects stepped to the left or right in response to congruous and incongruous visual cues that consisted of left and right arrows appearing on left or right sides of a monitor. The timing of postural adjustments was identified by inflection points in the vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) measured separately under each foot. Step responses could be classified into preferred and nonpreferred step behavior based on the number of postural adjustments that were made. Delays in onset of the first postural adjustment (PA1) and liftoff (LO) of the step leg during preferred steps progressively increased among the simple, choice, congruous, and incongruous tasks, indicating interference in processing the relevant visuospatial cue. Incongruous cues induced subjects to make more postural adjustments than they typically would (i.e., nonpreferred steps), representing errors in selection of the appropriate motor program. During these nonpreferred steps, the onset of the PA1 was earlier than during the preferred steps, indicating a failure to inhibit an inappropriate initial postural adjustment. The functional consequence of the additional postural adjustments was a delay in the LO compared with steps in which they did not make an error. These results suggest that deficits in inhibitory function may detrimentally affect step decision processing, by delaying voluntary step responses.},

@article{Mille2014,
abstract = {The initiation of human walking involves postural motor actions for body orientation and balance stabilization that must be effectively integrated with locomotion to allow safe and efficient transport. Our ability to coordinately adapt these functions to environmental or bodily changes through error-based motor learning is essential to effective performance. Predictive compensations for postural perturbations through anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) that stabilize mediolateral (ML) standing balance normally precede and accompany stepping. The temporal sequencing between these events may involve neural processes that suppress stepping until the expected stability conditions are achieved. If so, then an unexpected perturbation that disrupts the ML APAs should delay locomotion. This study investigated how the central nervous system (CNS) adapts posture and locomotion to perturbations of ML standing balance. Healthy human adults initiated locomotion while a resistance force was applied at the pelvis to perturb posture. In experiment 1, using random perturbations, step onset timing was delayed relative to the APA onset indicating that locomotion was withheld until expected stability conditions occurred. Furthermore, stepping parameters were adapted with the APAs indicating that motor prediction of the consequences of the postural changes likely modified the step motor command. In experiment 2, repetitive postural perturbations induced sustained locomotor aftereffects in some parameters (i.e., step height), immediate but rapidly readapted aftereffects in others, or had no aftereffects. These results indicated both rapid but transient reactive adaptations in the posture and gait assembly and more durable practice-dependent changes suggesting feedforward adaptation of locomotion in response to the prevailing postural conditions.},

@article{Lord2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND This study investigated the neuropsychological, sensorimotor, speed, and balance contributions to a new test of choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) and determined whether this new test is an important predictor of falls in older people. METHODS A total of 477 retirement-village residents aged 62 to 95 years (mean +/- SD, 79.2 +/- 6.2 years) took the CSRT test, which required them to step onto one of four panels that were illuminated in a random order. The subjects also took tests that measured neuropsychological, sensorimotor, speed, and balance function. RESULTS Multiple regression analysis revealed that poor performance in Part B of the Trail Making Test (a neuropsychological test) and impaired quadriceps strength, simple reaction time, sway with eyes open on a compliant surface, and maximal balance range were the best predictors of increased CSRTs (multiple r(2) =.45). Subjects with a history of falls had significantly increased CSRTs compared with nonfallers (1322 +/- 331 milliseconds and 1168 +/- 203 milliseconds, respectively). Impaired CSRT was a significant and independent predictor of falls, as were two complementary sensory measures (visual contrast sensitivity and lower limb proprioception). Of these measures, CSRT was the most important in predicting falls. Furthermore, the inclusion of CSRT in the model excluded measures of strength, central processing speed, and balance, because these could not provide nonredundant information for the prediction of falls. CONCLUSIONS This study identifies a new test that provides a composite measure of falls risk in older people and elucidates the relative importance of specific physiological and neuropsychological systems in the initiation of fast and appropriate step responses.},
