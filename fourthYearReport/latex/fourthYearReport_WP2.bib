  abstract = {Human beings are highly efficient in maintaining standing balance
	under the influence of different perturbations. However, biped humanoid
	robots are far from exhibiting similar skills. This is mainly due
	to the limitations in the current control and modelling techniques
	used in humanoid robots. Even though approaches using the Linear
	Inverted Pendulum Model and the Preview Control schemes have shown
	improved results, they still suffer from shortcomings in the overall
	generated motion. We propose here a model and control approach that
	aims to overcome the limiting assumptions in the LIPM models, through
	using the ankle joint variables in modelling and control of the standing
	balance of the humanoid robot.},

	This paper proposes a virtual sports system using a virtual reality

	between skilled and unskilled subjects are investigated through a
	series of experiments. Then, the human impedance of a skilled player
	is estimated and analyzed in the preliminary phase of motion.},
