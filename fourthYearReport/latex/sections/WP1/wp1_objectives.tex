\paragraph{WP1: toolbox for computing and controlling dynamics of whole-body movements with contacts (UB)}
The overall goal of this work package is to develop software libraries and
software modules to be used as toolbox by the entire project consortium.
Since all the deliverables of WP1 were delivered by the end of the third year,
the main goal of this WP in the fourth year was to improve the software and
enhance the iDyn Library.
