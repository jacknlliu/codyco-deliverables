\paragraph*{WP1: toolbox for computing and controlling dynamics of whole-body movements with contacts (UB)}

WP1 objectives were achieved for the fourth year.  In summary, the main
accomplishments and impacts for the research community are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  
\item In T1.3. IIT worked on enhancing the wholeBodyInterface.
\item In T1.5. IIT implemented BERDY C++ and sparse matrix representation.
\item In T1.3. UPMC kept on improving OCRA. 
\item In T1.5. INRIA developed different modules for visualization of torques,
  interfacing a haptic device and learning movement primitives.

\end{itemize}
