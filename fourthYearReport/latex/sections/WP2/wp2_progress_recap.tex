\paragraph*{WP2: understanding and modelling human whole-body behaviours in physical interaction (JSI)}

In T2.2 and also T2.3, UB continued on improving CoM dynamic manipulability as a tool to study, analyze and measure physical abilities of humans and robots.

In T2.4 UB explored the mechanism of human force perception aiming to provide natural and stable control for a humanoid robot in the similar manner with humans. Through this work, an experimental design has been developed, and a series of human subject experiments examined the anticipated goal-directed behaviour interacting with different compliant force dynamics.
