\paragraph*{WP2: understanding and modelling human whole-body behaviours in physical interaction (JSI)}

In T2.2 and also T2.3, UB continued on improving CoM dynamic manipulability as a tool to study, analyze and measure physical abilities of humans and robots.

In T2.4 UB explored the mechanism of human force perception aiming to provide natural and stable control for a humanoid robot in the similar manner with humans. Through this work, an experimental design has been developed, and a series of human subject experiments examined the anticipated goal-directed behaviour interacting with different compliant force dynamics.

Furthermore in T2.4, UB focused also on compliant contacts with support surfaces under uncertainty, where one of the important issues is the extraction of information about the contact surfaces through the sense of touch. UB conducted two psychology studies where they examined tactile roughness through perceptual judgments and brain activation, and one study where they examined the effects of tangential load force uncertainty on precision grip cooperative lifting.
