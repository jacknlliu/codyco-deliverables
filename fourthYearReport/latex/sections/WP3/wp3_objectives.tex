\paragraph{WP3: control and optimization of whole-body motion in contact (UPMC)}

The overall objective of this work package is to provide a control architecture dedicated to humanoid robots involved in personal/service applications, which imply physical interactions, i.e. contacts, with the environment. Such a control architecture is a requirement to bridge the existing gap between state-of-the-art methods in humanoid robots control and real-world applications.

During year 4, the objectives of WP3 were mostly focused on Task 3.4. More particularly, partners continued exploring learning approaches for contact situations (unknown location of the contact point, non-rigid contacts) in order to enrich the whole-body control approach developed in CoDyCo. They also contributed to adaptation methods allowing for the incremental improvement of tasks definitions and their proper activation and prioritization for successful whole-body motions in, potentially unexpected, contact situations.
