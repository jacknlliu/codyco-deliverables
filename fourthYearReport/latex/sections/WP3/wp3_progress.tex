\paragraph{Work package 3 progress}

The progress for each task are described hereafter.

\subparagraph{Reproducing existing control results in a simple case (T3.1)}

The explicit goal of T3.1 for the fourth year was to $\dots$

We achieved the following results $\dots$

\subparagraph{Formulating the control problem (T3.2)}

The explicit goal of T3.2 for the fourth year was to $\dots$

We achieved the following results $\dots$

\subparagraph{Solving the local control problem (T3.3)}

The explicit goal of T3.3 for the fourth year was to $\dots$

We achieved the following results $\dots$
    

\subparagraph{Bootstrapping and validating the control approach in rigid world and compliant cases (T3.4)}

The explicit goal of T3.4 for the fourth year was to $\dots$

We achieved the following results $\dots$
    
\subparagraph{Deviations from workplan}  

The PM expenses for WP3 after one year of project are globally conform to the planned one. The observed deviations are related to the fact that tasks 3.3 and 3.4 spans the overall duration of the project and the contribution of some of the partners are expected in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year.
