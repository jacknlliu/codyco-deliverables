\paragraph*{WP4: adaptation, generalization and improvement of compliant control and tasks with contacts (TUD)}

After the fourth year of project, WP4 objectives were achieved for the fourth year. In summary, the main accomplishments and impacts for the research community are as follows: 


\begin{itemize}

%Alex's work on learning task priorities
\item Based on the probabilistic movement representation of skills we developed a novel approach for learning task prioritizations from human demonstrations. Our approach follows the concept of ``soft'' priorities, where a task which is lower in the task-hierarchy can controllably interfere with a higher-priority task. 

\item We investigated how to generate whole-body ``safe'' motions, by optimizing the profile of task priorities with respect to a given fitness function under several strict constraints. We studied different black-box stochastic search algorithms to optimize the task priorities in a way that guarantees that constraints are never violated.
