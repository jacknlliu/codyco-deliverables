\paragraph*{WP4: adaptation, generalization and improvement of compliant control and tasks with contacts (TUD)}

After the fourth year of project, WP4 objectives were achieved for the fourth year. In summary, the main accomplishments and impacts for the research community are as follows: 

\begin{itemize}

\item[T4.1] IIT developed a model based In situ calibration procedure of six axis force torque sensors.

\item[T4.2] IIT worked on the self-calibration of joint offsets for humanoid robots using accelerometer measurements.

\item[T4.2] TUD extended its work on movement planning using recurrent neural networks.

\item[T4.4] TUD continued its work on learning task prioritizations from human demonstrations.

\item[T4.4] INRIA continued its research on automatically learning soft task priorities using stochastic optimization algorithms. 

\item[T4.4] UPMC worked on improving its approach for task compatibility optimization.

 \end{itemize}
