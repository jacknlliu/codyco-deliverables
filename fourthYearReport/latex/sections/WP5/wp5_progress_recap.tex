\paragraph*{WP5: systems integration, standardization and evaluation on the iCub robot (IIT)}

The fourth year WP5 activities have concentrated on the fourth year validation scenario. A complete description of the scenario can be found in ``D5.4 Validation scenario 4: learning how to stand up with the help of a human caregiver..'' which discusses the technical implementation of the fourth year validation scenario (see \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D5.4/pdf}). With respect to the state of the art the work progress represents an implementation of well established torques controlled whole-body control strategies. The integration of tactile feedback within the whole-body controller is a peculiarity of the implemented CoDyCo validation scenario and therefore represent a step forward with respect to the current state of the art. At the moment of writing the current deliverable the iCub tactile sensors cover the feet, the torso, the arms and the hands and the implemented validation scenario accounts for contacts at the hands and feet.
