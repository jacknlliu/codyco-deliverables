\paragraph*{WP5: systems integration, standardization and evaluation on the iCub robot (IIT)}

The fourth year WP5 activities have concentrated on the fourth year validation scenario. A complete description of the 
scenario can be found in ``D5.4 Validation scenario 4: learning how to stand up with the help of a human caregiver..'' 
which discusses the technical implementation of the fourth year validation scenario (see 
\url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D5.4/pdf}). With respect to the state of 
the art the effort of the CoDyCo consortium was directed towards real-time monitoring of human motion and forces.
This information allows an accurate and complete characterization of the human-robot physical interaction. Future
applications are foreseen in the field of adaptive control with specific focus on data driven reinforcement
learning. Possible reinforcement signals might be extrapolated from human extracted data, including but not limiting
to joint torques and contact forces.
