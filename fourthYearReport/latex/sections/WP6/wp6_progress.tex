\paragraph{Work package 6 progress}

Activities within work package 6 achieved the expected results both in terms of administrative activities and management activities. As a major result, the software repository was consolidated thanks to the versioning tool (git) and social coding website (\url{https://github.com}).

\subparagraph{Administrative coordination (T6.1)}
Administration was successfully coordinated by Chiara Andreoli at IIT. The major activity concerned an amendment that the CoDyCo consortium asked the main reason being the fact that Serena Ivaldi, initially hired by UPMC, lately moved to UPMC and finally integrated in the consortium with INRIA. Part of the administrative coordination activities were also conducted during the mid-year meeting: Nancy, November 22nd, 2016. Details on the meetings can be found in the CoDyCo website (\url{http://www.codyco.eu}).

\subparagraph{Software repository implementation (T6.2)}

A github software repository was set up \url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco} and the contribution from the different developers can be directly checked in the website.
