\paragraph{WP1: toolbox for computing and controlling dynamics of whole-body movements with contacts (UB)}

The overall goal of this work package is to develop software libraries and software modules to be used as toolbox by the entire project consortium. The expected outcomes for year 1 were for the consortium to agree on the architectures, interfaces, and modules necessary for the creation of a shared software toolbox, to fit both individual task requirements and the overall CoDyCo project objectives.  Additionally, at the end of year 1, an enhanced iCub simulator for whole-body contact simulation is to be released as part of deliverable D1.1.
