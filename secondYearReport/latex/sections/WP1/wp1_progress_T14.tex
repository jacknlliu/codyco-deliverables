\subparagraph{System dynamics estimation software. Extension to
environmental compliance estimation (T1.4)}

The goal of this task is to develop a software tool for on-line identification of whole-body dynamics, as well as the compliance of contacts established between the robot and the environment. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Within T1.4, IIT continued the activities started during the previous year, with specific focus on whole-body identification \cite{Traversaro2013, Traversaro2014}. In order to enhance the identification accuracy, an in-situ force/torque sensor calibration procedure was designed \cite{Traversaro2015b} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:validation}) and implemented in a software component\footnote{\url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/insitu-ft-calibration}.} which has been released with an open source license. Similarly, in order to enhance the torque estimation accuracy, IIT conducted a theoretical analysis that exploits embedded force/torque sensors. It has been proven \cite{Traversaro2015} that the inertial parameters estimated from embedded force/torque sensors can be successfully used for torque estimation.
\end{itemize}

\caption{The image shows the accuracy in calibrating the force/torque sensor with the procedure described in \cite{Traversaro2015b}. The four plots refer to four different experimental conditions (different values for the calibration weights). Ideally, perfectly calibrated data should lie on the surface of a three dimensional sphere. Dark green: force measurements obtained with the calibration matrix estimated using the proposed technique. Dark red: force measurements obtained with the calibration matrix provided with the sensor. Light red and light green surfaces: ellipsoids fitted to the measured forces. Qualitative calibration accuracy can be obtained by looking at the spherical symmetry of the fitted ellipsoids.}
