\paragraph{WP2: understanding and modelling human whole-body behaviours in physical interaction (JSI)}

There were three main objectives within WP2 for the second year of the project: (i) to thoroughly review and summarise the recent relevant literature on human postural control and whole body motion in contact with environment and/or human, and to define the protocols for experimental procedures, including obtaining ethics committee approval (Task 2.2), (ii) to work on designing of models for human whole body motion in contact where the aim was to form simplified models or high-level understanding of how additional supportive contacts affect human motor control strategies involved in balancing (Task 2.3), and (iii) to study the factors involved in human choice of contact utilization and to investigate how interaction through contacts can contribute to learning of whole body motor control (Task 2.3).
