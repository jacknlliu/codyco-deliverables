\paragraph{WP3: control and optimization of whole-body motion in contact (UPMC)}

The objectives of WP3 for the second year of the project are threefold. The first one is to demonstrate the applicability of state of the art whole-body motion controllers, such as the one developed in \cite{salini2012} and \cite{delprete2013}, within the simulation tools evaluated and retained in WP1 and for simple rigid, multi-contact scenarios. The second one is to propose a formulation and a solver for the whole-body control problem at the reactive level that provides a more expressive, richer description of the control problem as well as an efficient way of solving it. The third one is to identify existing or potential ways of optimally coupling the local, reactive control level and the global, decision making one.
