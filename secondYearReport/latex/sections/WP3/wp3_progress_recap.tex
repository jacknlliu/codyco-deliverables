\paragraph*{WP3: control and optimization of whole-body motion in contact (UPMC)}

After two years of project, the level of achievement of the objectives in WP3 meets the expectations. The main achievements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[T3.3] studies by UPMC and UB on the extension of whole-body control frameworks in order to account for non-rigid contacts.  The approach retained by UPMC adapts the desired contact force value and center of mass trajectory in order to establish stable and supporting contacts as fast as possible. This appproach assumes a local contact model but does not require the explicit knowledge of its parameters and rather uses the velocity of the contact point to directly adapt the desired contact force. UB computes optimal contact forces based on the momentum of the robot and computes and converts this forces into desired acceleration using an estimated model of the surface in contact. Given these desired accelerations, joint torques are computed in order to best achieve the desired accelerations.
\item[T3.4] 
\end{itemize}
