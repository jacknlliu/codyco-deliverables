\paragraph*{WP4: adaptation, generalization and improvement of compliant control and tasks with contacts (TUD)}

The goal of WP4 is to endow the CoDyCo
humanoid robot control architecture with the
core abilities for the adaptation, generalization
and self-improvement of both control laws and
tasks that involve physical interaction with
humans, and the environment.
During the second year, developed a novel 
probabilistic movement primitive representation that
can be used for imitation learning and for superimposing multiple motor tasks. 
TUD also started to investigate to predict the partner's behavior in 
human robot interaction scenarios.
