\subparagraph{Resources}

Resources were used with small difference with respect to what planned. In particular IIT invested only 2 PM with respect to 12PM planned. The motivation resides in the fact that WP5 took advantage of the significant effort done in WP1 (software) and WP3 (control) and in a sense resources initially planned on T5.1 eventually have been committed to T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, T3.1 and T3.2.

\subparagraph{Deviations from workplan} 
UPMC covered the activities within WP5 with own resources for a total of 0.45 PM. In particular Ryan Lober (PhD student, French PhD research grant) and Darwin Lau (Postdoctoral scholar) participated to the deployment of the whole-body interface developed in WP1 on the iCub robots present at UPMC.
