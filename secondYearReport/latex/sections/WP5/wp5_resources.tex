\subparagraph{Resources}

Resources were used with small difference with respect to what planned. In particular IIT invested only 2 PM with respect to 12PM planned. The motivation resides in the fact that WP5 took advantage of the significant effort done in WP1 (software) and WP3 (control) and in a sense resources initially planned on T5.1 eventually have been committed to T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, T3.1 and T3.2.
