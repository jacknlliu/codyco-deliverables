\paragraph{Work package 6 progress}

Activities within work package 6 achieved the expected results both in terms of administrative activities and management activities. As a major result, the software repository was successfully implemented thanks to novel versioning tool (git) and social coding website (\url{https://github.com}).

\subparagraph{Administrative coordination (T6.1)}
Administration was successfully coordinated by Chiara Andreoli at IIT. The major activity concerned an amendment that the CoDyCo consortium asked the main reason being the fact that Serena Ivaldi, initially hired by UPMC was recently hired by TUD. Part of the administrative coordination activities were also conducted during three main meetings: the kick-off meeting (Genoa, April 5th, 2013), the simulators meeting (Paris, June 5th, 2013) and the midyear meeting (Paris, November 21st-22nd, 2013). Details on the meetings can be found in the CoDyCo website (\url{http://www.codyco.eu}).

\subparagraph{Software repository implementation (T6.2)}

A github software repository was set up \url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco} and the contribution from the different developers can be directly checked in the website. Relevant information can be found also in ``D6.1 Website and repository online'' available here: \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D6.1/pdf}.
