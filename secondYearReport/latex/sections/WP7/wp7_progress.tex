\paragraph{Work package 7 progress}

Dissemination and exploitation activities included the participation to international events addressed to both commercial and academic institutions. 

\subparagraph{Dissemination activities towards academia, industry, and other users (T7.1)}

Dissemination activities were conducted in three main events: (1) iCub exposition at ICRA 2013, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation Karlsruhe, May 6 - 10, 2013; (2) iCub exposition at the European Robotics Forum and Innorobo, Lyon 29th March 2013; (3) iCub exposition at the European Robotics Forum, Rovereto 12th-14th of March 2014. The full list of papers published within CoDyCo can be found here: \url{http://codyco.eu/publications-menu}.

\subparagraph{Exploitation plan (T7.2)}

The second year activities on T7.1 and T7.2 are all contained in ``D7.1 Dissemination and exploitation plan'' available here: \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D7.1/pdf}.

\subparagraph{Management of IPR (T7.3)}

No activities to be reported during the second year on this task in consideration of the fact that the task started at the very end of the second year. As a minor starting activity the consortium circulated a list containing each partner responsible contact person for the IPR management. This list is contained in ``D7.1 Dissemination and exploitation plan'' available here: \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D7.1/pdf}.

\subparagraph{Dissemination of a database of human motion with contacts (T7.4)}

During the second year of CoDyCo, IIT completed the task of setting up a database for storing both human and robot datasets. The details on the database are reported in ``D7.2 Standard database with support materials'' available here \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D7.2/pdf}.
