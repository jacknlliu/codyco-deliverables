\paragraph{WP1: toolbox for computing and controlling dynamics of whole-body
  movements with contacts (UB)}

The overall goal of this work package is to develop software libraries and
software modules to be used as toolbox by the entire project consortium.  The
expected outcome for the third year was to develop such (shared) toolbox that
can be used by the entire group for dealing with compliant contacts.
