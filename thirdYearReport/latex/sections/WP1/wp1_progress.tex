\subparagraph{Software architecture design and evaluation of available
  open-source software pertinent to the scope of the project. (T1.1)}

The goal of T1.1 was to agree on a specific software architecture with
associated software tools whose specifications, dependencies and
interconnections meet the requirements and needs for achieving the goals of
the project.  The software, which is called \texttt{codyco-superbuild}, has
been available via github on
\texttt{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-superbuild} since the second year
of the project.  Details about the modules of the software are available in
deliverables D1.1, D1.2 and D1.3.

\subparagraph{Simulator for whole-body motion with contacts (T1.2)}

The CoDyCo project requires a modular, component-based dynamics simulation
software providing numerically stable, computationally efficient and
physically consistent simulations of whole-body virtual human(oid) systems in
contact with rigid or soft environments.  To this end, in year one, a new iCub
simulator was released and documented as part of deliverable D1.1.


\subparagraph{Control library for flexible specification of task space
  dynamics of floating base manipulators. (T1.3)}



\subparagraph{System dynamics estimation software. Extension to
environmental compliance estimation (T1.4)}

  
\subparagraph{Extension and enhancement of the iDyn library. (T1.5)}
