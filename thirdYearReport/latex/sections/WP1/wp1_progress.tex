\subparagraph{Software architecture design and evaluation of available
  open-source software pertinent to the scope of the project. (T1.1)}

The goal of T1.1 was to agree on a specific software architecture with
associated software tools whose specifications, dependencies and
interconnections meet the requirements and needs for achieving the goals of
the project.  The software, which is called \texttt{codyco-superbuild}, is
available via github on
\texttt{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-superbuild}. The modules and
specifications of the software are as follows:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{codyco-superbuild}: Main software repository (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-superbuild}).
  \item \texttt{idyntree}: Dynamics library designed for free floating robots
    (available from \url{https://github.com/robotology/idyntree}).
  \item \texttt{wholebodyinterface}: C++ Interfaces to sensor measurements,
    state estimations, kinematic/dynamic model and actuators for a floating base
    robot (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology/wholebodyinterface}).
  \item \texttt{yarp-wholebodyinterface}: Implementation of the
    wholeBodyInterface for YARP robots (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology/yarp-wholebodyinterface}).
  \item \texttt{WB-Toolbox}: Simulink Toolbox for rapid prototyping of Whole
    Body Robot Controllers (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology/WB-Toolbox}).
  \item \texttt{codyco-modules}: Whole-body Compliant Dynamical Contacts in
    Cognitive Humanoids (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules}).
  \item \texttt{mex-wholebodymodel}: Matlab MEX interface to the iWholeBodyModel
    interface (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology/mex-wholebodymodel}).
  \item \texttt{codyco-commons}: Miscellanous libraries developed in the CoDyCo
    project (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-commons}).
  \item \texttt{WBI-Toolbox-controllers}: Controllers developed using the
    WB-Toolbox (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/WBI-Toolbox-controllers}).
  \item \texttt{wholeBodyEstimator}: Algorithm developed for floating base
    estimation (available from
    \url{https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/modules/wholeBodyEstimator}).
  \item \texttt{LWR-ContactParams}: Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) algorithm
    for learning contact parameters of compliant contacts (this is available
    from \url{https://github.com/azadm/LWR_for_ContactParams.git}).
  \end{itemize}
  

\subparagraph{Simulator for whole-body motion with contacts (T1.2)}

The CoDyCo project requires a modular, component-based dynamics simulation
software providing numerically stable, computationally efficient and
physically consistent simulations of whole-body virtual human(oid) systems in
contact with rigid or soft environments.  To this end, in year one, a new iCub
simulator was released and documented as part of deliverable D1.1.


\subparagraph{Control library for flexible specification of task space
  dynamics of floating base manipulators. (T1.3)}



\subparagraph{System dynamics estimation software. Extension to
environmental compliance estimation (T1.4)}

  
\subparagraph{Extension and enhancement of the iDyn library. (T1.5)}
