\paragraph*{WP1: toolbox for computing and controlling dynamics of whole-body movements with contacts (UB)}
WP1 objectives were achieved for the third year.  In summary, the main
accomplishments are:

In T1.3 UPMC developed OCRA ``Optimization-based Control for Robotics Applications," a set of software tools to facilitate the development of optimization-based controllers.

In T1.4. UB and TUD developed a framework and software tool for parameter estimation of compliant contacts between the robot and the environment. 

In T1.5. IIT developed a YARP, C++ Kalman filter module for  singularity-free estimation of floating base position and orientation.
