\paragraph{WP2: understanding and modelling human whole-body behaviours in physical interaction (JSI)}

There were two main objectives within WP2 for the third year of the project: (i) to continue the work on designing of models for human whole body motion in contact where we focused on reducing the dimensionality of the actions taken by the human motor control apparatus during predictable (Task 2.2) and unpredictable (Task 2.3) perturbations of human whole-body behaviour; and (ii) to investigate how humans interact with compliant environment, to model how the viscoelastic parameters of the environment are represented by human CNS, and to study the factors involved in generalization and adaptation of skills learnt in contact with the compliant environment (Task 2.4).
