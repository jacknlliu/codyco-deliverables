\paragraph*{WP2: understanding and modelling human whole-body behaviours in physical interaction (JSI)}
~\par
In T2.3 JSI studied mutual learning of human and robot in case of interaction with a compliant environment. A novel method for shared control between the human and the robot was developed to efficiently facilitate the robot skill synthesis for the desired interaction.

In T2.2 and T2.4 UB examined how humans learn compliant force dynamics and modulate their whole-body motions to perform goals in contact with compliant environment. Generalization of learnt behavior was tested by examining the motions in environment with different viscoelastic properties.

In T2.2 and T2.3 JSI and UB performed an experimental study to verify the applicability of the manipulability metrics for analyzing postural control in contact with environment.

Finally, in T2.4 TUD and JSI were finalizing the study examining whether supporting contacts in human arm reaching are planned or are an effect of a reactive controller. UPMC and JSI continued with the experimental study to find a global trade-off arising from the interactions between movement time, cost and accuracy.
