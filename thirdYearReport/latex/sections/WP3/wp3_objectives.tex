\paragraph{WP3: control and optimization of whole-body motion in contact (UPMC)}

The overall objective of this work package is to provide a control architecture dedicated to humanoid robots involved in personal/service applications, which imply physical interactions, i.e. contacts, with the environment. Such a control architecture is a requirement to bridge the existing gap between state-of-the-art methods in humanoid robots control and real-world applications.

Similarly to year two, the objectives of WP3 for the third year of the project are threefold. The first one is to demonstrate the applicability of state of the art whole-body motion controllers, such as the one developed in \cite{salini2012} and \cite{delprete2013}, on the iCub robot in multi-contact, goal oriented scenarii (Task 3.4). The third one is to explore ways to enrich the retained whole-body controllers with the capability to interact with non-rigid environment (Task 3.3). The third one is to keep exploring potential ways of optimally coupling the local, reactive control level and the global, decision making one (Task 3.4). More particularly, the third year objectives include:
\begin{itemize}
\item the development of effective methods to deal with non compliant contacts, being them model-based or model free;
\item the extension of inverse dynamics learning techniques.
\end{itemize}
