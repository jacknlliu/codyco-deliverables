\paragraph*{WP3: control and optimization of whole-body motion in contact (UPMC)}

After three years of project, the level of achievement of the objectives in WP3 meets the expectations. The main achievements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[T3.2]  The generalized hierarchical control approach has been extended and applied in a quasi-static torque control framework on iCub.

\item[T3.3]  The development of model-free (UPMC) and model-based approaches (UB, IIT) for solving the whole-body reactive control problem in the case of compliant contact points has been pursued (witrh implementation in simulation (UPMC, UB) and on the iCub robot (IIT)).

\item[T3.4]  The development of the OCRA (Optimization-based Control for Robotics Applications) software libraries by UPMC.

\item[T3.4]  TUD is pusruing its research effort towards inverse dynamics model learning in presence of dynamic contacts.

\item[WP2-3] JSI and UPMC have explored experimentally and using a computational model the curved movement trajectories observed on diagonal reaching movement.
\end{itemize}
