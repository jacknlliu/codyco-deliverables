\subparagraph{Deviations from workplan} 
%@Francesco: You might want to print our justification of PM usage at a different position in the report.  
%Suggested statement by Jan P.
%available PMs will be filled in once our Secretary, Veronika Weber, returned from vacation.
TUD substantially underestimated the number of required PMs for the project and already consumed all assigned PMs during the first three years (79.9 PMs were used out of 76 PMs). It appears that 6.75 PMs are needed to complete Task 4.2, Task 4.3 and Task 4.4 in year 4. Due to the temporary problems of hiring a senior researcher in year one, two junior researcher had to fill this gap. Thus, there still exists sufficient budget for TODO:(XXX-2) PMs while TUD aims to contribute 2 PMs from its own endowed funding. In conclusion, this will result in no significant other deviations are reported.

% TUD used-up all their PMs during the first three years. For WP4 TUD spend 41.7PMs out of 38PMs and in total TUD spend 79.9PMs out of 76PMs. However, TUD has still budget left-overs because of a late hiring of a Post-Doc position. This position was temporally filled by a Ph.D. which got a lower pay. Therefore, TUD can spend additional TODO PMs by consuming the left-over budget during the last year. No significant other deviations are reported.
