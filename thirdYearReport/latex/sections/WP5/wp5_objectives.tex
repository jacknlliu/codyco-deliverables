\paragraph{WP5: systems integration, standardization and evaluation on the iCub robot (IIT)}

Work-Package 5 has focused on the implementation of the third-year validation scenario. This  scenario aims at verifying the control performances in the case the humanoid robot iCub must balance by means of compliant or dynamical contacts (see  \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/blob/master/D5.3/pdf/D5.3.pdf}).
