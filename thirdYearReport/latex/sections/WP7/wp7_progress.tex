\subparagraph*{Exploitation plan (T7.2)}

The third year activities on T7.1 and T7.2 are all contained in ``D7.1 Dissemination and exploitation plan'' available here: \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D7.1/pdf}.

\subparagraph*{Management of IPR (T7.3)}

No activities to be reported during the third year on this task in consideration of the fact that the task started at the very end of the third year. As a minor starting activity the consortium circulated a list containing each partner responsible contact person for the IPR management. This list is contained in ``D7.1 Dissemination and exploitation plan'' available here: \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D7.1/pdf}.

During the third year of CoDyCo, IIT completed the task of setting up a database for storing both human and robot datasets. The details on the database are reported in ``D7.2 Standard database with support materials'' available here \url{https://github.com/robotology-playground/codyco-deliverables/tree/master/D7.2/pdf}.
