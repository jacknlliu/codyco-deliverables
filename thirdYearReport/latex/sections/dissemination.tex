\subsection{IIT contributions to dissemination}

\subsubsection{Invited talks}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Event: invited researcher at Tokyo University (Japan), Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Informatics, Department of Mechano-Informatics, School of Information Science and Technology. Period: from October 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015.
\item  Event: invited researcher at AIST (Japan), CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory UMI3218/RL (JRL) situated at the Intelligent Systems Research Institute (IS), National Institute of Advance Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). Period: from November 15, 2015 to December 6, 2015.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{International events organisation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The iCub Summer School, "Veni Vidi Vici", serves to consolidate and disseminate skills in software engineering for humanoid robots. Our goal is to foster collaboration on robot software across the boundaries and lifetimes of specific platforms and projects.
The school focuses on humanoid robotics and will host at least two iCub and a COMAN robot. Students will receive an initial training on the software infrastructure (middleware and tools) and will be required to work on a project of their choice. All participants are expected to be competent C/C++ programmers with an interest in working with others (and an agenda of their own). Info: \url{http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/VVV15}

\item During the IROS 2015 International Conference at Hamburg, different versions of iCub (the Genova Black, and the Heidelberg version) were shown in an exhibition. For three days, iCub interact with visiting people performing different demos, such as torque balancing and the red ball demo. Photo by Fabian Bimmer/Reuters)


\item iCub has been a special guest in Ballar\'o, an italian political show on the public television network.

\item In May, Francesco Nori was an invited speaker at the Creative Mornings event. The talk gave historical and philosophical motivations that guided recent research activities towards the problem of studying how humans interact with the environment and among themselves. The iCub was also presented, as an open-source platform capable of advancing the state-of-the-art in various directions, e.g. decisional autonomy, dependability/adaptability, perception and, in a single all-embracing word, cognitive abilities.

\item In July, during the RSS conference in Rome, a full day workshop titled ``Towards a Unifying Framework for Whole-body and Manipulation Control'' has been organised. Topics covered the following areas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Contacts planning and control
\item Whole-body task control
\item Compliant whole-body movements
\item Dynamics in humanoid robots
\item Machine learning and optimization methods for contact planning and control
\end{itemize}

\item From 22nd of October to 1st of November 2015, the iCub will be showed at the ``Festival della Scienza''. Festival della Scienza, now at its 13th edition, is a publicly opened event which focus on science. During this festival, temporary laboratories and exhibition booths are prepared where researchers and scientists can show and explain to people their work. Presentations are targeted to different audiences, from children to university students to adults. This year festival theme is ``Equilibrium'', and iCub will perform daily showing balancing demos. 

\item Live video shooting at ``Italians got talent'', italian national television show. Shooting: December 1st-3rd 2015. Location: Catanzaro, Italy. The iCub performed the CoDyCo demo based on whole-body torque controlled motions with switching motions.

\item Live demonstrations at the event: ``Italian Manufacturing Forum'', UIC Gleacher Center, Chicago, IL, March 30th, 2016. The iCub was shipped to Chicago to perform several iCub related demonstrations (e.g. iCub standing, iCub performing whole-body equilibrium tasks) at the Italian Manufacturing Forum.
